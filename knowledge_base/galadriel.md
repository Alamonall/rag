G_aladriel was the Ñ_oldorin Lady of the woods of L_othlórien who witnessed M_iddle-earth during the three Ages of Awakening.

G_aladriel was born in A_man as one of the Ñ_oldor. She was the daughter of F_inarfin and E_ärwen, and younger sister of F_inrod, A_ngrod, and A_egnor.[5] She took part in the Exile of the Ñ_oldor, following F_ëanor in his rebellion. However, she opposed the Kinslaying at A_lqualondë and crossed the H_elcaraxë with the rest of F_ingolfin's followers. After arriving in B_eleriand, she lived mainly in D_oriath, where she befriended M_elian. Later, with her husband C_eleborn, she ruled over the woodland Elves of L_othlórien, and together they had a daughter, C_elebrían, who married E_lrond.

She is described as "the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in M_iddle-earth",[6] and the "greatest of Elven women".[7] Throughout the T_hird Age it was unknown who wielded the Three R_ings,[8] but during the W_ar of the R_ing, G_aladriel revealed to F_rodo B_aggins that she was the bearer of N_enya.[9] After the War, she returned to the U_ttermost West.

Later history
G_aladriel, C_eleborn, and their company attended the wedding of A_ragorn and A_rwen in M_inas T_irith. Soon afterward they joined the crowded funeral riding of King T_héoden to R_ohan. After the funerals in the Golden Hall, they continued their travel northwards with other companions and halted in I_sengard. T_reebeard revealed that he had freed S_aruman, and regretted that he would not see G_aladriel and C_eleborn again. C_eleborn replied that he was unsure, but G_aladriel affirmed that it would be her last meeting with him, giving T_reebeard some cryptic words concerning A_rda E_nvinyanta[45]. They continued on their way and encountered S_aruman, who, released by T_reebeard, snapped that she had always hated him, and that he would find comfort now knowing that her realm was destroyed as well as his.[46]

Two years later, on September 22 of the year 3021,[44] F_rodo and S_am encountered a Wandering Company while traveling around The S_hire, and found that E_lrond, G_aladriel, and B_ilbo B_aggins were a part of it. N_enya was visible on G_aladriel's finger, and she seemed to shine like the moon. F_rodo decided to depart with them and the H_obbits joined the company led by E_lrond and G_aladriel.[47] On September 29, they reached M_ithlond and departed over the sea at the very end of the T_hird Age.[44]

Sometime later during the F_ourth Age, she received C_eleborn, her husband.[48] In the year 120,[49] it is said that G_imli sailed to the West alongside L_egolas out of his desire to see G_aladriel again. He may have been allowed thanks to her intervention.[50]
