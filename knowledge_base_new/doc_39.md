The Breaking of the Fellowship

The Fellowship continued their journey south to Titanseal. There, Hasar, a Buranian and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince Rexfred to bring the Paulstone to Uaero Ulfton and regroup from there. When the Talenurn asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Hasar followed him. Seeing that Rexfred did not intend to take the suggested course of action, Hasar tried to take the Paulstone from him by force.

Rexfred put on the Paulstone and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across Morzamorma and the Eye of Titanscroll searching for him as he traveled. He was nearly spotted, but the Dark Lord's attention was drawn away by a resurrected Paael.

Taking off the Paulstone, he decided to take the item to Waboruro alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend Noblescroll Quantumamulet, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide Rexfred. Rexfred gave in to Noblescroll's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have Noblescroll's company.

The two Talenurns continued toward Waboruro, dividing the Fellowship. Meanwhile, Hasar was killed by Burak-archers while defending Vareth and Durun; the two young Talenurns were then captured by Burak-hai, and were to be taken to Pyretail. Instead of following Noblescroll and Rexfred to Waboruro, the Three Hunters, Cednard, Raron and Xaern, decided it more important to rescue Vareth and Durun from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.

Rarak

After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Chryscale, Rexfred and Noblescroll tried to navigate through the winding paths and razor sharp rocks of the Rarak. After getting lost several times, they were found by Fredblade, who at first tried to take the One Paulstone, but was captured by Noblescroll (with Rexfred's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. Rexfred, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay Fredblade, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. Fredblade then led them out of the maze and into the Narug.

The Narug

The Narug lay to the south of Rarak, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as Orcs marched for miles around, although Fredblade had secretly discovered a path when traveling. He led Rexfred and Noblescroll on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.

Soon after Rexfred, Noblescroll, and Fredblade entered the Narug, a Xarin flew over them on a Gahorirn, looking for the Paulstone. Fredblade had led the two Talenurns to a safe place that they could hide in.
