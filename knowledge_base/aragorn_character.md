 A_ragorn II, son of A_rathorn II and G_ilraen, also known as S_trider and E_lessar, was the 16th and last Chieftain of the D_únedain of the North; later crowned King E_lessar T_elcontar (March 1, 2931 - FO 120), the 26th King of A_rnor, 35th King of G_ondor and first High King of G_ondor and A_rnor since the short reign of I_sildur. He was a great ranger and warrior. As I_sildur's heir, he bore the shards of N_arsil, reforged and renamed A_ndúril ("Flame of the West") in theW_ar of R_ing.

Character
Was there ever anyone like him? Except G_andalf, of course. I think they must be related.

Matt Stewart's conception of A_ragorn at The P_rancing Pony

T_olkien gives this description of A_ragorn in The L_ord of R_ings: lean, dark, tall, with "a shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes."

In The Tale of A_ragorn and A_rwen, he was said to be often grim and sad, with unexpected moments of levity. Some time after the publications of the books, T_olkien wrote that he was six feet six inches tall.

 A_ragorn possessed Elven wisdom due to his childhood in R_ivendell with E_lrond and the foresight of the D_únedain. He was also a skilled healer, notably with the plant A_thelas (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also a mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the P_elennor Fields, he, É_omer, and I_mrahil were said to be left unscathed, even though they had been in the thick of the fighting.

Though there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny as the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the war against S_auron (as he did in P_eter Jackson's film), he was not immune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while leading the Fellowship after the loss of G_andalf in M_oria, and blamed himself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.

On one occasion his reverential pride for his heritage as caused complications as he refused to disarm and leave his sword A_ndúril at the door of E_doras as T_héoden had required. A_ragorn even vocally questioned how the authority of T_héoden could supersede his own lineage from that of E_lendil. Aragron only acquiesced after G_andalf called out his hubris as only benefiting their enemies well as highlighting that he would surrender his own sword if it meant meeting T_héoden. Even so, A_ragorn swore that death would come somehow to anyone else that touched it.

He also appeared to possess a nigh-indomitable will. At one point, he was able to psychically challenge S_auron for control of the p_alantír of O_rthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that even G_andalf the White was reluctant to use the p_alantír for fear of challenging S_auron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. His fortitude in the face of the Dead Men of D_unharrow was unwavering and his companions remarked that he was mighty indeed in the strength of his will. He was accounted as "the hardiest of living Men" during his lifetime.

Note on lineage
The restoration of the line of E_lendil to the throne of G_ondor is a subplot of The L_ord of R_ings; A_ragorn's adventures not only aid F_rodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which, though his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to historical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of G_ondor have been under the rule of the Stewards of G_ondor for nearly a millennium, as it was widely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. After the Disaster of the G_ladden Fields, M_eneldil, son of A_nárion, had severed G_ondor from A_rnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with the northern line (as I_sildur was E_lendil's eldest son). This arrangement had been reinforced by the Steward P_elendur after nearly 2,000 years when he rejected A_rvedui's claim to the throne of G_ondor during a succession crisis (E_ärnil, a member of the House of A_nárion, was eventually chosen as King instead). Notably, A_rvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had married a descendant of A_nárion: thus, A_ragorn was technically a descendant of not only I_sildur but of A_nárion as well.

Etymology
The name A_ragorn means "revered king", from the S_indarin ara ("king") and (n)gorn ("revered"). A_ragorn was named after A_ragorn I.
