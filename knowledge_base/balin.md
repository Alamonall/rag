B_alin was a Dwarf leader, the son of F_undin, and elder brother of D_walin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied T_horin II O_akenshield on the quest to regain the L_onely Mountain.
A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of T_horin's closest friends and advisers. B_alin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of D_urin.

He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in M_oria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

Biography
Early life
B_alin was likely born in the L_onely Mountain before the coming of the dragon S_maug. He had a younger brother named D_walin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when S_maug attacked the L_onely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in D_unland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of A_zanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately T_A 2841, he accompanied T_hráin II, the father of T_horin, when he attempted to go back to the L_onely Mountain himself. T_hráin was captured and lost.

Expedition into M_oria

In T_A 2989,[14] B_alin led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of M_oria, hoping to re-establish Dwarven rule and to reclaim the last of the Seven R_ings of the Dwarves.[15] Though his king did not give his consent, B_alin and company went anyway. Among his numbers were fellow members of T_horin's company Ó_in and O_ri. While in M_oria, he discovered D_urin's Axe and a M_ithril helm (possibly the crown of D_urin I) and claimed them as his own. After the discovery of these items B_alin, being a descendant of the line of D_urin, claimed rulership over the Dwarven realm, taking the title Lord of M_oria (his colony being too small to be counted as a kingdom). Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been taken from T_hráin II by S_auron.

Death
After ruling as M_oria's Lord for about five years, B_alin was slain by Orcs on November 10 T_A 2994,[14] after going to look upon the M_irrormere alone. His body was recovered after a battle, and entombed in the Chamber of M_azarbul. The attempt to retake M_oria ultimately failed afterward, as the rest of his kin were eventually trapped and killed.[16] Ironically, he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in T_A 2799.[1]

Legacy

Some twenty-five years later in T_A 3019, the Fellowship of the R_ing passed through M_oria and discovered B_alin's tomb, and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the Book of M_azarbul. The knowledge of this brought much grief to B_alin's cousin G_imli, who was a member of the fellowship.[16]

Characteristics
B_alin was a discerning character, being described as the company's "look-out man": He spotted B_ilbo approaching the G_reen Dragon Inn at Bywater; he spotted the trolls' fire, and; he was the first to spot the Elves in M_irkwood. He noted that not even a mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice B_ilbo (hidden by wearing the magic r_ing) when he was lookout for the company after escaping the Orcs in the M_isty Mountains. Among the Dwarves of the company, B_alin was the second-eldest dwarf, and loosely held the position of deputy leader.

B_alin gained respect for B_ilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who volunteered to accompany B_ilbo down the secret passage to S_maug's chamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, B_alin was the only one known to have visited B_ilbo at B_ag End after their quest for the L_onely Mountain.
