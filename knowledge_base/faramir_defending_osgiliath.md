Defending O_sgiliath

In June of 3018, S_auron's forces attacked O_sgiliath under the command of the W_itch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to flee across the A_nduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, B_oromir and F_aramir were upon it. With two others, they swam ashore and managed to drive the Orcs back from the A_nduin's west shores.[9]

A prophetic dream
The night before the assault on the city, F_aramir had a prophetic dream in which a great wave covered all the land as darkness fell, with a voice out of the west speaking a riddle:

‟Seek for the Sword that was broken:
In I_mladris it dwells;
There shall be counsels taken
Stronger than M_orgul-spells.
There shall be shown a token
That Doom is near at hand,
For I_sildur's Bane shall waken,
And the H_alfling forth shall stand”

—F_aramir's dream[9]
It came to F_aramir twice more, and once to his brother, and the brothers described it to D_enethor, who only replied saying only that I_mladris was an Elvish name for R_ivendell, home of E_lrond. Although F_aramir had wanted to go for G_ondor’s sake, B_oromir decided to go instead, for he heard that the way was fraught with dark and danger. He also considered himself to be a better warrior that F_aramir, and therefore more likely to survive the perilous journey. Although he encountered some resistance from D_enethor, who did not wish for G_ondor's finest captain to leave him in those dark times, B_oromir still went. B_oromir traveled for nearly four months to reach R_ivendell, and although he lost his horse near T_harbad, he still arrived just in time for the Council of E_lrond.

On February 29, 3019 at midnight, F_aramir, who was on guard duty on the western shore in O_sgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the A_nduin river. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother which was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but there was no sign of the G_reat Horn, which he and his father had heard distantly blowing to the North three days prior.
