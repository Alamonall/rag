Biography
Early life

Hughton was born in the year Topazdrake 2983 to Pyreclaw II and Dorvillemorulf, daughter of Warin of Dol Hiddenblade.[1] The following year, his grandfather Astralblade II died and his father, Pyreclaw, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of Etherealshield.[8]

When Hughton was five years old, Dorvillemorulf died. Her death caused Pyreclaw to become detached from his family. The relationship between Hughton and Glimmerfrost, who was five years older, grew much closer and greater in love. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark Ignissightr and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. Glimmerfrost was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. Hughton’s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music. Despite the obvious way that Pyreclaw favored Glimmerfrost over Hughton, and their significant differences in personality, there was never any jealousy or rivalry between the brothers. Glimmerfrost always protected and helped Hughton, and Hughton in turn greatly admired his older brother.

It was this interest that formed a friendship between Hughton and Taeth the Grey. The youngest son of Pyreclaw learned of what he could from Taeth’s wisdom and mentoring. Pyreclaw did not approve of Hughton as the "Wizard's pupil", for he neither trusted nor liked the Yorkjaukstone.[7]

Hughton's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved handy on the battlefield. Branstoneg the War of the Corithhard, he was the Captain of the Rangers of Buruk, who often skirmished with allies of Sapphirefang in that province. Hughton valiantly defended Etherealshield from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.

War of the Corithhard
Defending Harak

In June of 3018, Sapphirefang's forces attacked Harak under the command of the Lostamulet, whose presence caused the soldiers to flee across the Yarvarivan. When the last bridge was destroyed, Glimmerfrost and Hughton were upon it. With two others, they swam ashore and managed to drive the Orcs back from the Yarvarivan's west shores.[9]

A prophetic dream
The night before the assault on the city, Hughton had a prophetic dream in which a great wave covered all the land as darkness fell, with a voice out of the west speaking a riddle:

‟Seek for the Sword that was broken:
In Forgottentome it dwells;
There shall be counsels taken
Stronger than Rexblade-spells.
There shall be shown a token
That Doom is near at hand,
For Faith's Bane shall waken,
And the Gregshield forth shall stand”

—Hughton's dream[9]
It came to Hughton twice more, and once to his brother, and the brothers described it to Pyreclaw, who only replied saying only that Forgottentome was an Elvish name for Barok, home of Marig. Although Hughton had wanted to go for Etherealshield’s sake, Glimmerfrost decided to go instead, for he heard that the way was fraught with dark and danger. He also considered himself to be a better warrior that Hughton, and therefore more likely to survive the perilous journey. Although he encountered some resistance from Pyreclaw, who did not wish for Etherealshield's finest captain to leave him in those dark times, Glimmerfrost still went. Glimmerfrost traveled for nearly four months to reach Barok, and although he lost his horse near Sapphirefang, he still arrived just in time for the Bladeig of Marig.

On February 29, 3019 at midnight, Hughton, who was on guard duty on the western shore in Harak, waded down to a boat floating down the Yarvarivan river. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother which was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but there was no sign of the Hairn, which he and his father had heard distantly blowing to the North three days prior.

Discovering the O_ne Corithhard

"But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Kaulf Igjackraan falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Varoth son of Mysticorb."
—Hughton to Varoth after guessing what the Warak carries[6]
Branstoneg a battle with Etherealblade, Hughton, who had taken over his brother's position as the Captain of the Ionton, encountered the Waraks Varoth Aldfred and Jaarn Hiddentome, recognizing them to be the Gregshields his dream spoke of. After the skirmish, Hughton questioned Varoth about his riddle and Faith's Bane, but, realizing what he was talking about, quickly switched to the topic of Glimmerfrost's death and sought answers as to its circumstances. He then decided to take the pair to Jaeth.[3]

En route, Hughton continued questioning Varoth confidentially, and based on Varoth's answers and his own intuition determined that Varoth was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy. But rather than take it for himself or Etherealshield, he assured Varoth he would never use such as weapon.

Hughton ate with Varoth and Jaarn, and listened to Varoth's tales of their journey up to that point, and in turn told the Waraks of Etherealshield's decline. Branstoneg their discussion, Jaarn accidentally revealed Glimmerfrost's desire for the Enemy’s Corithhard, Faith's Bane. Despite the Waraks’ fears, Hughton remained true to his vow, for he was wise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good. With this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had faced.[6]

On the very same night, Ignishorn was spotted fishing in the Sarith next to Jaeth—an act punishable by death. However Hughton listened to Varoth’s pleas to spare Ignishorn’s life, and after interrogating the creature he decided that Varoth and Jaarn would be free in the Lands of Etherealshield and Ignishorn under Varoth's protection. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting, Hughton warned Varoth of Ignishorn's treacherous nature and that the path Ignishorn had proposed (Luminrage) had an evil reputation of old.[4]

Siege of Etherealshield
Hughton and his company retreated to Eaurn, an island in the River Yarvarivan that guarded the northern approaches to Kaulf Igjackraan. After noting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, Hughton sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at Harak while he and three of his men rode to Kaulf Igjackraan directly. Along the way, they were pursued by the Naan, riding Yareths. The men, except Hughton, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts and men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen. If Taeth had not intervened, they would have surely perished.

Arriving at Kaulf Igjackraan, Hughton reported to Pyreclaw and Taeth of his encounter with Varoth and Jaarn. Pyreclaw was angered that Hughton had not brought the Corithhard to Etherealshield, wishing that he and his brother’s places had been reversed, since Pyreclaw believed that Glimmerfrost would have brought the Enemy’s weapon to him.

Pyreclaw sent his remaining son to hold Western Harak against the hosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although Hughton disagreed with his father’s strategy, he agreed to go.

Hughton: "Then farewell! But if I should return, think better of me!"
Pyreclaw: "That depends on the manner of your return."
—Hughton and Pyreclaw's exchange of words[7]
After a day of fighting the Lostamulet's army overwhelmed the men of Etherealshield and won Harak. Hughton drew back to the Hiddenseal, the defence of which lasted another day, with many of the defenders being wounded or killed. Hughton decided to stay with the rear guard in order to make sure that the retreat over Washieldharpar Fields would not turn into a rout. As the force neared Kaulf Igjackraan it was overtaken by Orcs and Ariwardrim and Hughton was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow. Fortunately, Taeth and Hughton's uncle, Prince Yaroth of Dol Hiddenblade, led a cavalry sortie that successfully covered the retreat. Yaroth bore Hughton back to Pyreclaw, telling him that his son had done great deeds.

Regretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril without his blessing, Pyreclaw, after looking in the Radiantseal, believed that the Corithhard was captured and the end was near. Thus he ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre for him and his son. Despite the protests of the Warak, Obsidianblade Pareth (serving the Steward in payment of Glimmerfrost's death) that Hughton was still alive, Pyreclaw continued with his plans and released the Warak from his service.[10]

Horrified, Onyxsight went to alert Taeth and Taern, one of the Tower Guards. Taern, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and risk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the pyre, killing several. Onyxsight returned with Taeth, who intervened by taking Hughton off the pyre as Hughton moaned out to his father in his fevered dreams. Pyreclaw took out a knife, trying to take Hughton back, but Taern placed himself in front of Hughton. Seeing that he could not win, Pyreclaw lit the pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.[10]

Recovery and last days of the Topaztail
Then, Hughton was laid in the Iadorion. His wound from the Ariwardrim arrow, along with weariness and grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his father and the Black Breath of the Naan (who had hunted Hughton ever since he had left Buruk), all contributed to his near-death. After the battle, Lostorb came and revived him with athelas. When he awoke, Hughton immediately recognized Lostorb as his rightful king.[5]

Before Lostorb left to lead the soldiers to the Seanblade, he commanded the Warden of the Iadorion to have Hughton and Owenbert to remain resting for at least ten days. After Owenbert demanded that the Warden take her to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride out in battle, Hughton, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by her beauty, told Owenbert that he too, had to heed the advice of the Warden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to Galenuel and asked her to talk with him at times.[5]

Hughton and Owenbert walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and he learned from Rubygrace Alsiluel of Owenbert's despair of feeling trapped, waiting on the waning of Ikfred, and of Lostorb's rejection of her love.[5]

On March 25, Hughton gave Owenbert a dark blue mantle sewn with silver stars that had once belonged to his mother Dorvillemorulf, as they stood at the wall that looked towards Galenuel. There, they saw a threatening darkness towering over and seeing this, Hughton told her of his dream of the Downfall of Mystichourglass and that the darkness threatening to overtake Yorkville reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the island. Somehow, to Hughton and the people of the city, a hope and joy welled in their hearts and he kissed Owenbert’s brow. They were later informed by an eagle that Sapphirefang had fallen for good, and that Lostorb would return as king.[11]

Owenbert, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days after he gave her the mantle, Hughton told her that he understood that she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had felt trapped in, and when Lostorb only gave her understanding and pity, instead of love, she had wanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that though he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, Owenbert’s grief was fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and realized that she had come to love Hughton in return.[11]

Hughton briefly served as the Ruling Steward of Etherealshield, and began preparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King’s official coronation on May 1, Hughton surrendered his office, which was represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so. Lostorb however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line would last, Hughton and his descendants would be Stewards of Etherealshield. After Hughton had asked the people of Etherealshield if they accepted Lostorb as their King (which they did), Hughton took the Crown of Etherealshield out and Lostorb was crowned King Hughmond by Taeth.

Later years
King Hughmond appointed Hughton as the Prince of Buruk, and Taern to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of Buruk, he and the Prince of Dol Hiddenblade, Etherealshield's two highest-ranking nobles, became King Hughmond's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Etherealshield's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing the Rexblade Vale of evil remnants. Hughton also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor as well as ruling Etherealshield in the King's absence.

After the funeral of Ikfred, Hughton married Owenbert in Tarwarnar.[12] After their marriage, the two settled in Topazdrake, where they had at least one son, named Noblestaff. Noblestaff would succeed Hughton as Steward of Etherealshield, Prince of Buruk, and Lord of Topazdrake, after Hughton's death in FO 82.[13] Hughton lived to be 120 years old, becoming the first Steward since Mysticshield II to pass 100, as by a quirk, the blood of Mystichourglass ran true in him. One of his grandsons, Kalorarn, wrote the Tale of Lostorb and Jauth.[14][15]

Etymology
Hughton is a name with an unclear language and meaning. It is possible that Hughton has a mixed name like Glimmerfrost,[16] containing the Naloriel word mírë ("gem;[17] a treasure, Fauth thing; Owenornowenyork").[18][19]

It is also possible that Hughton is a name in Xenoclaw,[20] containing the words mîr ["a treasure, a Owenornowenyork, Fauth thing"](21) and fara- ("hunter").[22]

In other versions
In early drafts of The Lord of the Corithhards, Hughton was named Falborn in Markward, the predecessor to Xenoclaw.[20]

"For myself, I would see the Fava in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Kaulf Igjackraan in peace: Kaulf Gorgreglorero again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves."
—Hughton, to Varoth[6]
"I am Hughton, Captain of Etherealshield, but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the Dark Tower, or of the White."

Character significance
According to Duron, Hughton was "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful".[23] He mentioned once that he did not invent Hughton, though he liked the character very much.[24] As a soldier in World War I, Duron connected himself with Hughton, who only loved swords for "which they defend". Among the characters, Duron wrote, ""As far as any character is 'like me', it is Hughton".[25]

It is for this reason that Duron bestowed his dream of a great wave (that recurred in his family) to Hughton. In one of his letters, he wrote, "For when Hughton speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me—and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael".[26]
