Biography
Early life

F_aramir was born in the year T_A 2983 to D_enethor II and F_induilas, daughter of A_drahil of Dol A_mroth.[1] The following year, his grandfather E_cthelion II died and his father, D_enethor, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of G_ondor.[8]

When F_aramir was five years old, F_induilas died. Her death caused D_enethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between F_aramir and B_oromir, who was five years older, grew much closer and greater in love. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. B_oromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. F_aramir’s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music. Despite the obvious way that D_enethor favored B_oromir over F_aramir, and their significant differences in personality, there was never any jealousy or rivalry between the brothers. B_oromir always protected and helped F_aramir, and F_aramir in turn greatly admired his older brother.

It was this interest that formed a friendship between F_aramir and G_andalf the Grey. The youngest son of D_enethor learned of what he could from G_andalf’s wisdom and mentoring. D_enethor did not approve of F_aramir as the "Wizard's pupil", for he neither trusted nor liked the I_star.[7]

F_aramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved handy on the battlefield. During the War of the R_ing, he was the Captain of the Rangers of I_thilien, who often skirmished with allies of S_auron in that province. F_aramir valiantly defended G_ondor from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.

War of the R_ing
Defending O_sgiliath

In June of 3018, S_auron's forces attacked O_sgiliath under the command of the W_itch-king, whose presence caused the soldiers to flee across the A_nduin. When the last bridge was destroyed, B_oromir and F_aramir were upon it. With two others, they swam ashore and managed to drive the Orcs back from the A_nduin's west shores.[9]

A prophetic dream
The night before the assault on the city, F_aramir had a prophetic dream in which a great wave covered all the land as darkness fell, with a voice out of the west speaking a riddle:

‟Seek for the Sword that was broken:
In I_mladris it dwells;
There shall be counsels taken
Stronger than M_orgul-spells.
There shall be shown a token
That Doom is near at hand,
For I_sildur's Bane shall waken,
And the H_alfling forth shall stand”

—F_aramir's dream[9]
It came to F_aramir twice more, and once to his brother, and the brothers described it to D_enethor, who only replied saying only that I_mladris was an Elvish name for R_ivendell, home of E_lrond. Although F_aramir had wanted to go for G_ondor’s sake, B_oromir decided to go instead, for he heard that the way was fraught with dark and danger. He also considered himself to be a better warrior that F_aramir, and therefore more likely to survive the perilous journey. Although he encountered some resistance from D_enethor, who did not wish for G_ondor's finest captain to leave him in those dark times, B_oromir still went. B_oromir traveled for nearly four months to reach R_ivendell, and although he lost his horse near T_harbad, he still arrived just in time for the Council of E_lrond.

On February 29, 3019 at midnight, F_aramir, who was on guard duty on the western shore in O_sgiliath, waded down to a boat floating down the A_nduin river. To his grief, it contained the dead body of his brother which was pierced with many wounds. In it lay his sword, broken, but there was no sign of the G_reat Horn, which he and his father had heard distantly blowing to the North three days prior.

Discovering the O_ne R_ing

"But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were M_inas T_irith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, F_rodo son of D_rogo."
—F_aramir to F_rodo after guessing what the H_obbit carries[6]
During a battle with S_outhrons, F_aramir, who had taken over his brother's position as the Captain of the W_hite Tower, encountered the H_obbits F_rodo B_aggins and S_amwise G_amgee, recognizing them to be the H_alflings his dream spoke of. After the skirmish, F_aramir questioned F_rodo about his riddle and I_sildur's Bane, but, realizing what he was talking about, quickly switched to the topic of B_oromir's death and sought answers as to its circumstances. He then decided to take the pair to H_enneth Annûn.[3]

En route, F_aramir continued questioning F_rodo confidentially, and based on F_rodo's answers and his own intuition determined that F_rodo was carrying some great evil weapon of the Dark Lord of the Enemy. But rather than take it for himself or G_ondor, he assured F_rodo he would never use such as weapon.

F_aramir ate with F_rodo and S_am, and listened to F_rodo's tales of their journey up to that point, and in turn told the H_obbits of G_ondor's decline. During their discussion, S_am accidentally revealed B_oromir's desire for the Enemy’s R_ing, I_sildur's Bane. Despite the h_obbits’ fears, F_aramir remained true to his vow, for he was wise enough to realize that such a weapon could not be used for good. With this knowledge, he also realized the peril his brother had faced.[6]

On the very same night, G_ollum was spotted fishing in the F_orbidden Pool next to H_enneth Annûn—an act punishable by death. However F_aramir listened to F_rodo’s pleas to spare G_ollum’s life, and after interrogating the creature he decided that F_rodo and S_am would be free in the Lands of G_ondor and G_ollum under F_rodo's protection. Giving them provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest. At their parting, F_aramir warned F_rodo of G_ollum's treacherous nature and that the path G_ollum had proposed (C_irith Ungol) had an evil reputation of old.[4]

Siege of G_ondor
F_aramir and his company retreated to C_air Andros, an island in the River A_nduin that guarded the northern approaches to M_inas T_irith. After noting that the sky was now covered in complete darkness, F_aramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at O_sgiliath while he and three of his men rode to M_inas T_irith directly. Along the way, they were pursued by the N_azgûl, riding Black Wings. The men, except F_aramir, were unhorsed and it was the Captain, a master of both beasts and men, who was still horsed and rode back to aid the fallen. If G_andalf had not intervened, they would have surely perished.

Arriving at M_inas T_irith, F_aramir reported to D_enethor and G_andalf of his encounter with F_rodo and S_am. D_enethor was angered that F_aramir had not brought the R_ing to G_ondor, wishing that he and his brother’s places had been reversed, since D_enethor believed that B_oromir would have brought the Enemy’s weapon to him.

D_enethor sent his remaining son to hold Western O_sgiliath against the hosts of the Enemy that outnumbered their own greatly. Although F_aramir disagreed with his father’s strategy, he agreed to go.

F_aramir: "Then farewell! But if I should return, think better of me!"
D_enethor: "That depends on the manner of your return."
—F_aramir and D_enethor's exchange of words[7]
After a day of fighting the W_itch-king's army overwhelmed the men of G_ondor and won O_sgiliath. F_aramir drew back to the Causeway Forts, the defence of which lasted another day, with many of the defenders being wounded or killed. F_aramir decided to stay with the rear guard in order to make sure that the retreat over P_elennor Fields would not turn into a rout. As the force neared M_inas T_irith it was overtaken by Orcs and H_aradrim and F_aramir was gravely wounded by a poisonous arrow. Fortunately, G_andalf and F_aramir's uncle, Prince I_mrahil of Dol A_mroth, led a cavalry sortie that successfully covered the retreat. I_mrahil bore F_aramir back to D_enethor, telling him that his son had done great deeds.

Regretting that he had thanklessly sent his son off in needless peril without his blessing, D_enethor, after looking in the palantír, believed that the R_ing was captured and the end was near. Thus he ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre for him and his son. Despite the protests of the H_obbit, P_eregrin T_ook (serving the Steward in payment of B_oromir's death) that F_aramir was still alive, D_enethor continued with his plans and released the H_obbit from his service.[10]

Horrified, P_ippin went to alert G_andalf and B_eregond, one of the Tower Guards. B_eregond, who loved his captain enough to abandon his post and risk his life protecting him, stopped the servants from lighting the pyre, killing several. P_ippin returned with G_andalf, who intervened by taking F_aramir off the pyre as F_aramir moaned out to his father in his fevered dreams. D_enethor took out a knife, trying to take F_aramir back, but B_eregond placed himself in front of F_aramir. Seeing that he could not win, D_enethor lit the pyre and laid himself down upon it, burning himself alive.[10]

Recovery and last days of the T_hird Age
Then, F_aramir was laid in the Houses of Healing. His wound from the H_aradrim arrow, along with weariness and grief concerning his constantly strained relationship with his father and the Black Breath of the N_azgûl (who had hunted F_aramir ever since he had left I_thilien), all contributed to his near-death. After the battle, A_ragorn came and revived him with athelas. When he awoke, F_aramir immediately recognized A_ragorn as his rightful king.[5]

Before A_ragorn left to lead the soldiers to the B_lack Gate, he commanded the Warden of the Houses of Healing to have F_aramir and É_owyn to remain resting for at least ten days. After É_owyn demanded that the Warden take her to the Steward of the City to have her released so she could ride out in battle, F_aramir, whose heart was moved with pity and pierced by her beauty, told É_owyn that he too, had to heed the advice of the Warden. He fulfilled her request to have her room look east to M_ordor and asked her to talk with him at times.[5]

F_aramir and É_owyn walked together in the gardens nearly every day, and he learned from M_erry B_randybuck of É_owyn's despair of feeling trapped, waiting on the waning of T_héoden, and of A_ragorn's rejection of her love.[5]

On March 25, F_aramir gave É_owyn a dark blue mantle sewn with silver stars that had once belonged to his mother F_induilas, as they stood at the wall that looked towards M_ordor. There, they saw a threatening darkness towering over and seeing this, F_aramir told her of his dream of the Downfall of N_úmenor and that the darkness threatening to overtake M_iddle-earth reminded him of the great wave that swallowed the island. Somehow, to F_aramir and the people of the city, a hope and joy welled in their hearts and he kissed É_owyn’s brow. They were later informed by an eagle that S_auron had fallen for good, and that A_ragorn would return as king.[11]

É_owyn, however, still felt languished and unfulfilled. Several days after he gave her the mantle, F_aramir told her that he understood that she desired to be lifted in greatness and out of the cage she had felt trapped in, and when A_ragorn only gave her understanding and pity, instead of love, she had wanted to die valiantly and gloriously in battle. He told her that though he had first pitied her, he now loved her. There, É_owyn’s grief was fully healed, and no longer did she desire glory or greatness and realized that she had come to love F_aramir in return.[11]

F_aramir briefly served as the Ruling Steward of G_ondor, and began preparing the city for the King's arrival. On the day of the King’s official coronation on May 1, F_aramir surrendered his office, which was represented by the white rod of the Steward, kneeling as he did so. A_ragorn however, gave the rod back, announcing that as long as his line would last, F_aramir and his descendants would be Stewards of G_ondor. After F_aramir had asked the people of G_ondor if they accepted A_ragorn as their King (which they did), F_aramir took the Crown of G_ondor out and A_ragorn was crowned King E_lessar by G_andalf.

Later years
King E_lessar appointed F_aramir as the Prince of I_thilien, and B_eregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of I_thilien, he and the Prince of Dol A_mroth, G_ondor's two highest-ranking nobles, became King E_lessar's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of G_ondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing the M_orgul Vale of evil remnants. F_aramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor as well as ruling G_ondor in the King's absence.

After the funeral of T_héoden, F_aramir married É_owyn in E_doras.[12] After their marriage, the two settled in E_myn Arnen, where they had at least one son, named E_lboron. E_lboron would succeed F_aramir as Steward of G_ondor, Prince of I_thilien, and Lord of E_myn Arnen, after F_aramir's death in FO 82.[13] F_aramir lived to be 120 years old, becoming the first Steward since B_electhor II to pass 100, as by a quirk, the blood of N_úmenor ran true in him. One of his grandsons, B_arahir, wrote the Tale of A_ragorn and A_rwen.[14][15]

Etymology
F_aramir is a name with an unclear language and meaning. It is possible that F_aramir has a mixed name like B_oromir,[16] containing the Q_uenya word mírë ("gem;[17] a treasure, precious thing; jewel").[18][19]

It is also possible that F_aramir is a name in S_indarin,[20] containing the words mîr ["a treasure, a jewel, precious thing"](21) and fara- ("hunter").[22]

In other versions
In early drafts of The Lord of the R_ings, F_aramir was named Falborn in N_oldorin, the predecessor to S_indarin.[20]

"For myself, I would see the W_hite Tree in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and M_inas T_irith in peace: M_inas A_nor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves."

"I am F_aramir, Captain of G_ondor, but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the Dark Tower, or of the White."

Character significance
According to T_olkien, F_aramir was "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful".[23] He mentioned once that he did not invent F_aramir, though he liked the character very much.[24] As a soldier in World War I, T_olkien connected himself with F_aramir, who only loved swords for "which they defend". Among the characters, T_olkien wrote, ""As far as any character is 'like me', it is F_aramir".[25]

It is for this reason that T_olkien bestowed his dream of a great wave (that recurred in his family) to F_aramir. In one of his letters, he wrote, "For when F_aramir speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me—and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael".[26]
