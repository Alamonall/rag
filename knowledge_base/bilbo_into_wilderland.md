Into Wilderland
The group traveled to B_eorn's hall where they rested, after being gruffly taken in by B_eorn and his animal servants. B_eorn learned their story and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. B_eorn also lent several ponies to be used until the group reached M_irkwood. However, B_eorn did not fully trust the Dwarves, so B_ilbo saw B_eorn giving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. When the company arrived at the Forest Gate the ponies were let go (to several of the Dwarves discontent) and G_andalf left the group as well, warning them, "Do not stray off the path."[7]

The Company began to follow the Elf-path through the treacherous forest. Eventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send B_ilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. B_ilbo climbed up a tree, where a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. B_ilbo only saw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not see that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the Dwarves, where they met the news with ill comfort, angry that they were fatter than B_ilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or see the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The Company then came upon the Enchanted stream, of which they had been warned not to drink by B_eorn. B_ilbo saw a boat on the other side, leading the Dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of nowhere when all the Dwarves were on the other side. A Dwarf shot it where it died, on the other side. The Dwarves hoped for venison for dinner, when B_ilbo realized that B_ombur was drowning. The Dwarves fished him out to find he had been put to sleep by the stream's magic, but the boat was knocked away, ending the hope for venison.

While wandering down the path, the Dwarves saw lights in the forest. Deciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they headed after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went out and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the third time all of them fell asleep.

When B_ilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the Dwarves for leaving the path and discovered that great spiders had captured his companions. B_ilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through the cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted the spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate them, and succeeded when the creatures left their domain to find the intruder and eat him. B_ilbo killed a few by throwing stones at them and by stabbing them with S_ting. The spiders never found him, since During this time B_ilbo made use of the R_ing to remain invisible. After freeing the Dwarves, he led them into a charge against the spiders, where the company killed dozens of the arachnids.[8]

After traveling through M_irkwood the Dwarves were taken prisoner by Wood-elves, who believed that the company had "assaulted" the Elves while they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the forest). B_ilbo avoided being caught by using the R_ing to stay invisible, and followed them into the Halls of T_hranduil, the Elven-king, where they were held captive. Eventually B_ilbo was able to rescue the Dwarves by stealing the chief of the guard's keys, and found a way for the company to escape the Woodland Realm by stowing away in a number of empty barrels, which periodically were taken by the Elves down the Forest River to L_ake-town for trading purposes. The plan worked, and soon they all arrived at L_ake-town, which they found to be a small town occupied by Men that S_maug would sometimes attack, though he had not been seen in many years.[9]

The captain of the guard in L_ake-town took B_ilbo and the Dwarves to the Great House to present the company to the Master and his councilors, and though the Master initially thought to imprison them in order to keep good relations with the wood-elves, he decided against it when the populace proved to be strongly in support of T_horin's company. Thus, B_ilbo and the Dwarves spent several weeks in L_ake-town as guests of honor, though B_ilbo eventually caught a cold.[10]
