T_hird Age
Rule in L_órien
In the year 109 of the early T_hird Age, G_aladriel and C_eleborn's daughter C_elebrían wedded E_lrond the Half-elven.[8] The did not stay at first with her, however, for G_aladriel was filled with foreboding, and was concerned about the growing shadow in M_irkwood and Dol G_uldur. Therefore she and C_eleborn made long journeys investigating R_hovanion, going from G_ondor and the borders of M_ordor to T_hranduil in Northern M_irkwood. They also stayed a long time in L_órien with king A_mroth, for G_aladriel saw with her wisdom that this prosperous realm could be a stronghold against the growing Shadow, if it had better rule.[36] At this point, the Order of Wizards arrived in M_iddle-earth, and only G_aladriel, E_lrond, and C_írdan knew where they came from.[6] Around the year 1100, the Wise, including G_aladriel as one the chief E_ldar, were well aware of the evil dwelling in Dol G_uldur, but thought it was one of the Nazgûl.[8]

After their enquiries, G_aladriel and C_eleborn passed over the mountains to I_mladris, and there dwelt for many years with their kin.[36]

Between the years 1980 and 1981, a terror appeared in K_hazad-dûm and the Dwarves abandoned the realm, while the many S_ilvan Elves from L_órien had to flee south.[8] To make things worse, A_mroth was lost, leaving no heir, and the Elven realm was left without a ruler. Therefore C_eleborn and G_aladriel went there, welcomed by the people, and took up the rule jointly, but refused to take the royal title and were called the Lord and Lady of the G_aladhrim instead. Saving the realm from the perils of the moment, they dwelt and ruled permanently there.[36]

As the shadow of Dol G_uldur grew again, the W_hite C_ouncil was formed in the year 2463.[8] It was summoned by G_aladriel,[9] who, being a good friend of G_andalf, recommended that he be made head of the C_ouncil. But this distinction fell instead to S_aruman.[6]

In the year 2510, her daughter C_elebrían departed to the West after being wounded by Orcs.[8] That same year, she aided E_orl and his riders in the B_attle of the Field of Celebrant by creating a white mist that drove out the shadows from Dol G_uldur, unintentionally causing their descendants to regard her and the Golden Wood with fear.[37]

The W_hite C_ouncil would not take action until G_andalf discovered that the shadow growing in Dol G_uldur was S_auron. After deliberating, the C_ouncil joined forces and drove S_auron out of Dol G_uldur in the year 2941.[8]

Some years later, A_ragorn II entered L_othlórien after many travels, and was admitted by G_aladriel. She bade him to change his worn-out clothes and dressed him like a proper prince. During that time, A_ragorn became betrothed to her granddaughter A_rwen.[38]
