Life in R_ivendell
Between T_A 3003 and T_A 3018, B_ilbo worked on the written account of his adventures, in a book that would later be known as the R_ed Book of Westmarch. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a three-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called Translations from the Elvish. He composed a poem for A_ragorn as well as a much longer poem about E_ärendil During his stay at R_ivendell.[21]

In October 3018, F_rodo arrived at R_ivendell. B_ilbo learned that his nephew was on a quest to destroy the One R_ing and offered to take the R_ing to M_ordor himself at the Council of E_lrond. His offer was politely declined due to his age, so B_ilbo gave F_rodo the sword S_ting and for protection his M_ithril Coat. However, he remained in R_ivendell while F_rodo traveled south. After F_rodo returned, B_ilbo had noticeably aged, partially freed from the R_ing's effects, although he continued to desire it.

Since B_ilbo had been a R_ing-bearer, he was allowed to accompany F_rodo to the U_ndying Lands. On September 22, 3021, B_ilbo turned 131 and became the oldest H_obbit ever to have lived. On September 29, he, G_andalf, E_lrond, G_aladriel, and F_rodo boarded a ship docked at the G_rey Havens and sailed away from M_iddle-earth, with B_ilbo exclaiming he was excited for yet another adventure. His fate afterward is not known but as he too was a mortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of V_alinor.[22]
