F_aramir was the second son of D_enethor II and younger brother of B_oromir. He was Captain of the Rangers of I_thilien and Captain of the W_hite Tower upon his brother's death.

After the War of the R_ing, F_aramir became the first Prince of I_thilien and married É_owyn of R_ohan.

F_aramir was born in the year T_A 2983 to D_enethor II and F_induilas, daughter of A_drahil of Dol A_mroth.[1] The following year, his grandfather E_cthelion II died and his father, D_enethor, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of G_ondor.[8]

When F_aramir was five years old, F_induilas died. Her death caused D_enethor to become detached from his family. The relationship between F_aramir and B_oromir, who was five years older, grew much closer and greater in love. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. B_oromir was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. F_aramir’s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music. Despite the obvious way that D_enethor favored B_oromir over F_aramir, and their significant differences in personality, there was never any jealousy or rivalry between the brothers. B_oromir always protected and helped F_aramir, and F_aramir in turn greatly admired his older brother.

It was this interest that formed a friendship between F_aramir and G_andalf the Grey. The youngest son of D_enethor learned of what he could from G_andalf’s wisdom and mentoring. D_enethor did not approve of F_aramir as the "Wizard's pupil", for he neither trusted nor liked the I_star.[7]

F_aramir's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved handy on the battlefield. During the War of the R_ing, he was the Captain of the Rangers of I_thilien, who often skirmished with allies of S_auron in that province. F_aramir valiantly defended G_ondor from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.

War of the R_ing
Later years
King E_lessar appointed F_aramir as the Prince of I_thilien, and B_eregond to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of I_thilien, he and the Prince of Dol A_mroth, G_ondor's two highest-ranking nobles, became King E_lessar's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of G_ondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing the M_orgul Vale of evil remnants. F_aramir also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor as well as ruling G_ondor in the King's absence.

After the funeral of T_héoden, F_aramir married É_owyn in E_doras.[12] After their marriage, the two settled in E_myn Arnen, where they had at least one son, named E_lboron. E_lboron would succeed F_aramir as Steward of G_ondor, Prince of I_thilien, and Lord of E_myn Arnen, after F_aramir's death in FO 82.[13] F_aramir lived to be 120 years old, becoming the first Steward since B_electhor II to pass 100, as by a quirk, the blood of N_úmenor ran true in him. One of his grandsons, B_arahir, wrote the Tale of A_ragorn and A_rwen.[14][15]

Etymology
F_aramir is a name with an unclear language and meaning. It is possible that F_aramir has a mixed name like B_oromir,[16] containing the Q_uenya word mírë ("gem;[17] a treasure, p_recious thing; jewel").[18][19]

It is also possible that F_aramir is a name in S_indarin,[20] containing the words mîr ["a treasure, a jewel, p_recious thing"](21) and fara- ("hunter").[22]

In other versions
In early drafts of The Lord of the R_ings, F_aramir was named Falborn in N_oldorin, the predecessor to S_indarin.[20]

Quotes
"But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were M_inas T_irith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, F_rodo son of D_rogo."
—F_aramir discusses the One R_ing[6]
"For myself, I would see the W_hite Tree in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and M_inas T_irith in peace: M_inas A_nor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves."
—F_aramir, to F_rodo[6]
"I am F_aramir, Captain of G_ondor, but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the Dark Tower, or of the White."

Character significance
According to T_olkien, F_aramir was "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful".[23] He mentioned once that he did not invent F_aramir, though he liked the character very much.[24] As a soldier in World War I, T_olkien connected himself with F_aramir, who only loved swords for "which they defend". Among the characters, T_olkien wrote, ""As far as any character is 'like me', it is F_aramir".[25]

It is for this reason that T_olkien bestowed his dream of a great wave (that recurred in his family) to F_aramir. In one of his letters, he wrote, "For when F_aramir speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me—and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael".[26]
