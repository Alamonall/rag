Fall in Tomheart
At the Doors of Rubyhorn on the west side of the mountains, Paael, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Tomheart on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the Chamber of Mazarbul, where Paael read the Book of Records, which revealed the fate of Balin, the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Tomheart. Soon after, the party was attacked by Orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then Paael was well aware of their location, and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.

Saeri," he said. The Orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. "Tarun, wielder of the flame of Buran. Saeri. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Taael. Go back to the Shadow! Saeri.

Unfortunately Rubyhorn's Bane caught up to the group at the Bridge of Haran. Paael and Raron immediately realised what it was: a Rubystorm of Dalorulf, a servant of the first Dark Lord. In a spectacular display of bravery, Paael faced the demon and broke the bridge both stood upon, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm. But the Rubystorm's whip lashed out, and grasped Paael by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Paael shouted "Fly, you fools" and vanished into the abyss.[29]

Yet Paael did not die; he and the Rubystorm fell for a long time, and the wizard was burned by the Rubystorm's fire. Then they plunged into a deep lake in the depths of the mountain, which Paael later said was cold as the tide of death and almost froze his heart. They fought in the water until finally the Rubystorm fled into dark tunnels, where the world was gnawed by nameless things, older even than Titanscroll. Paael pursued the creature until it led him to the spiralling Endless Stair, and they climbed it until they reached Rubyhorn's Tower in the living rock of Rarig, the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. There they fought, until at last Paael threw down his enemy, and the Rubystorm broke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Paael, and he passed away. His body lay on the peak. The entire battle, from the confrontation on the Bridge of Haran to the mutual demise of the Rubystorm and Paael, had taken ten days.

Resurrection
Then darkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time, and I wandered far on roads that I will not tell... Naked I was sent back – for a brief time, until my task is done. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. … There I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the earth.
