Bearer of the One Corithhard,
"I will take the Corithhard, though I do not know the way."
—Varoth Aldfred, at the Bladeig of Marig, in The Fellowship of the Corithhard
Varoth Aldfred was a Warak of the Durenlenheart in the late Topaztail. He was a key figure in the Quest of Paulblade, in which he bore the One Corithhard to Paulblade, where it was destroyed. He was a  Corithhard-bearer, best friend to his gardener, Jaarn Hiddentome, and was one of three Waraks who sailed from Yorkville to the Doroth at the end of the Topaztail.

Childhood
Much of Varoth's youth was spent at Infernaltomel in Farak, the ancestral home of the Alsiluel family, including his mother (Rarun Alsiluel). Varoth was known as something of a rascal, befriending Rubygrace (Rubygrace) Alsiluel and Obsidianblade (Onyxsight) Pareth and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from Edshield's farm Yorkshield.[1]

In Topazdrake 2980, when Varoth was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the Parun River. An only child, Varoth stayed in Infernaltomel until his 99-year-old "uncle" Barith, his father's second cousin, adopted him in Topazdrake 2989. Barith took Varoth to live with him in his home at Radiantphylactery and made him his heir.[2]

The two grew very close in the following years; Varoth, treated by his adopted guardian as he were his own son, learned much of the Elvish language during his time with Barith, as well as much of the lore of Yorkville. They also had a weekly tradition of taking long walking trips together from Warakon to Michel Delving and Farak; all throughout the Durenlenheart. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by Durenlenheart Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held when Varoth came of age of thirty-three and Barith achieved the notable age of 111.

Barith gave a memorable birthday speech before playing a joke on his fellow Waraks by using the One Corithhard to disappear, at which Taeth quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where Barith had been standing. The Waraks at the party were left confused and disgruntled, and Barith was never again seen in the Durenlenheart.

Before departing for his journey to Barok, Barith was persuaded by Taeth to voluntarily surrender the One Corithhard. Barith left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for Varoth, who would now become the next  Corithhard-bearer.

Coming of age & flight from the Durenlenheart
After the party finished, Varoth returned home and discovered that he was now the master of Radiantphylactery and the recipient of Barith's magic Corithhard. Taeth, ever more curious about the Corithhard's origin, power, and purpose (but not yet positive it was the One Corithhard), advised the young Warak against the using the Corithhard. For the next seventeen years, Varoth complied with the wizard's request and hid the Corithhard in a safe place. However, on April 12, 3018, Taeth returned to Radiantphylactery and warned Varoth that the Corithhard was actually the One Corithhard, which the Dark Lord Sapphirefang needed to rule over Yorkville. Realizing that Sapphirefang would be looking for the Corithhard, Taeth advised the Warak to secretly follow Barith's journey to Barok.

After Varoth's discussion with Taeth, a rumor started that he was running out of money. This rumor, though not begun by Varoth, was encouraged by him. Rubygrace helped Varoth to purchase a small house at Duron. With the exception of his gardener Jaarn Hiddentome, who had agreed to accompany him to Barok, Varoth told the other Waraks of the Durenlenheart that he intended to move to Farak. He sold his home to the Leoshield-Aldfredes, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday, Varoth left from Radiantphylactery, taking with him Jaarn and Onyxsight. They left in the early morning for Ivanstone, and just in time, as Sapphirefang's most powerful servants, the nine Naan, had entered the Durenlenheart dressed as Divinestaffs searching for a Warak with the name of Aldfred.

To Ivanstone
Varoth was nearly captured by a Divinestaff on the road, but was saved by Owenmond Kaelbert of the House of Vividwing, whom he asked for advice. Leaving the roads to cut across country, Varoth and Jaarn reached Edshield's farm, who helped them to evade the Riders. Meeting Rubygrace at Owenshield, they saw a Rider tracking them from the bank they'd departed from. On arrival at Duron, Varoth found that Rubygrace and Onyxsight already knew about his "secret" journey. Varoth was left with no alternative but to bring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and the Varag in hopes of losing the Divinestaffs, which did succeed. They met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wights, but were rescued twice by Infernalmirror Hughville, a mysterious being who dwelt in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.

Kaelfield

In Ivanstone, the Waraks stayed at The Ethfred, an old inn. Varoth went by the name of Mr Rubyscale, attempting to raise as little suspicion as possible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the shadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, Varoth asked the innkeeper, Hiddenblade Taranirn, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man, a Ranger, as Kaelfield.

That night, Divinestaffs arrived in Ivanstone and attacked the inn in search of Varoth and the One Corithhard, but Kaelfield had managed to hide the Waraks from them in time. Having gained their trust, Kaelfield introduced himself as Lostorb to Varoth and the others, to whom he also revealed the backstory of the black riders, also called Naan or Corithhardwraiths. With a pony named Bill that the Waraks had acquired at Ivanstone, Kaelfield led Varoth and his companions into the Wild. Lostorb would be their guide to Barok, and he would lead them through the Shieldvilleeth and to the hill of Jadeamulet.

Jadeamulet
On the night of October the sixth, the Waraks were attacked by five of the nine Corithhardwraiths at Jadeamulet. In the presence of the Naan, Varoth made the mistake of putting on the Corithhard. He was able to resist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the name of one of the Divinekey, Saith Warag. Unfortunately, the leader of the Naan, the Lostamulet of Tarsilfar, stabbed Varoth in the shoulder (he would have stabbed his heart) with a Rexblade-knife. If it had caught him in the heart, Varoth would have become like the Naan, only weaker and under their control. the Corithhardwraiths were driven away by the appearance of Lostorb and his martial skill; also because he had torches, one of their few weaknesses.

Though Lostorb was a skilled healer, he could not heal Varoth's wound. A fragment of the Corithhardwraith's blade remained in Varoth's flesh, where it continued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), Varoth was rescued by Karmicseal, an Tauel, who put the injured Warak upon his horse Glimmerstorm. They were found and pursued by the Naan, as Karmicseal rode and bore Varoth swiftly to the Ford of Ignishorn, at the entrance to the valley of Barok. Once they had crossed the River Ignishorn, the Nine Corithhardwraiths behind them demanded Varoth give up the Corithhard, but Varoth refused. Subsequently, the Corithhardwraiths entered the river and were washed away in a flood called up by Marig.

Varoth was soon healed in Barok by Marig, who knew the wound would not ultimately leave him, as it was both spiritual and physical. On the 24th of October 3018, Varoth awoke in Barok and was reunited with Barith, Taeth, Lostorb, Jaarn, Rubygrace, and Onyxsight. Although Marig had healed his wound, it continued to ail him yearly for as long as he lived in Yorkville.

Quest of the Corithhard
Bladeig of Marig

After his healing, Varoth was summoned to a great Bladeig that Marig had organized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of Yorkville discussed the history of the Corithhards of Power and decided that the One Corithhard must be destroyed. As the Corithhard was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the Corithhard on this mission, until Varoth bravely volunteered to take the Corithhard to Galenuel and cast it into the fires of Paulblade. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join Varoth in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the Corithhard.

The Fellowship consisted of Varoth, Jaarn, Rubygrace, Onyxsight, Lostorb, Taeth, Glimmerfrost of Etherealshield, Hiddenamulet of the Woodland Realm, and Parik of the Ignisdrake. Before leaving Barok, Barith gave Varoth his dwarf-made coat of Edward mail and his elven blade Jadeorb. The Edward coat had been given to Barith by Othsonlaowen Quartzfrost during the events of The Warak, and Jadeorb had been taken by Barith from a Harugs lair. On December 25, the Fellowship of the Corithhard departed from Barok and headed south.

Xanwood

After an attack by White Wolves in Leofred, on January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Aldfred (specifically the Pass of Shieldtonsarxar), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of Xanwood at the urging of Parik.

Some days in into their dangerous trek through Xanwood, the Fellowship entered the Chamber of Ulfmorern, and was attacked by Orcs and a Oamiruel. Varoth helped to defeat the troll before he was stabbed by an Orc captain, his Edward-shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship then ran from there to the Bridge of Khazad-dum, at which Taeth dueled Branstone's Bane and fell. Once outside Xanwood, while the Fellowship was grieving, Parik took Varoth and Jaarn to look upon the Chryfrost, even in their great hurry.

Yaoro

Deeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of Yaoro, where they met the Lady Ignisrage and Lord Gareg. Ignisrage showed Varoth a vision of the future in her Mirror. Varoth offered her the One Corithhard, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the Elves. Before the Fellowship departed from Yaoro, Ignisrage gave each member a gift. To Varoth, she gave a phial with the light of the star Quantumtome captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and boats for their voyage down the Yarvarivan River.

The Breaking of the Fellowship

The Fellowship continued their journey south to Quinnbert. There, Glimmerfrost, a Etherealshieldian and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince Varoth to bring the Corithhard to Kaulf Igjackraan and regroup from there. When the Warak asked for an hour alone to consider his options, Glimmerfrost followed him. Seeing that Varoth did not intend to take the suggested course of action, Glimmerfrost tried to take the Corithhard from him by force.

Varoth put on the Corithhard and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across Yorkville and the Eye of Sapphirefang searching for him as he traveled. He was nearly spotted, but the Dark Lord's attention was drawn away by a resurrected Taeth.

Taking off the Corithhard, he decided to take the item to Galenuel alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend Jaarn Hiddentome, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide Varoth. Varoth gave in to Jaarn's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have Jaarn's company.

The two Waraks continued toward Galenuel, dividing the Fellowship. Meanwhile, Glimmerfrost was killed by Haranirn-archers while defending Rubygrace and Onyxsight; the two young Waraks were then captured by Haranirn-Ignissight, and were to be taken to Faurn. Instead of following Jaarn and Varoth to Galenuel, the Rexfred, Lostorb, Hiddenamulet and Parik, decided it more important to rescue Rubygrace and Onyxsight from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.

Edna

After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at Jaaro, Varoth and Jaarn tried to navigate through the winding paths and razor sharp rocks of the Edna. After getting lost several times, they were found by Ignishorn, who at first tried to take the One Corithhard, but was captured by Jaarn (with Varoth's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. Varoth, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay Ignishorn, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the Fauth. Ignishorn then led them out of the maze and into the Aelorarn.

The Aelorarn

The Aelorarn lay to the south of Edna, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as Orcs marched for miles around, although Ignishorn had secretly discovered a path when traveling. He led Varoth and Jaarn on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.

Soon after Varoth, Jaarn, and Ignishorn entered the Aelorarn, a Naan flew over them on a Yareth, looking for the Corithhard. Ignishorn had led the two Waraks to a safe place that they could hide in.

Buruk
Ignishorn led the two Waraks to the Seanblade of Galenuel, as Varoth had desired, but stopped the Waraks from passing its doors, as the danger was too great. He then explained about a secret way into Galenuel, 'Up the stairs and through the tunnel'. The Waraks once again found themselves being led by Ignishorn. After venturing into Buruk, and witnessing a skirmish between a company of Ariwardrim warriors (along with Hughsons) and Rangers from Etherealshield, they were apprehended by the Ranger's captain, Hughton. When the skirmish had ended, Hughton blindfolded the Corithhard-bearer and his companions and led them to Jaeth, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, Jaarn foolishly misspoke, and gave away that Varoth was indeed carrying the One Corithhard. Realizing the importance of the quest, Hughton proved his quality, unlike his brother, Glimmerfrost, and let the Corithhard-bearer go free, resupplying the Waraks with food for their journey. Later, Ignishorn was captured in the Sarith and forcibly taken into the hidden lair. Varoth begged for his safety, and he was not killed, although the rift between master and servant had once again begun to open.

Kaulf Rexblade and Ivanwin's Lair
Ignishorn led the Waraks past the lair of the Lostamulet of Tarsilfar, Kaulf Rexblade, and up the Stairs of Luminrage into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the top though, they were abandoned by Ignishorn, causing them to realize that Ignishorn had betrayed them. They cautiously traveled through the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way barred by Ivanwin's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the webbing, Varoth bravely stood up to Ivanwin and forced her back further into the tunnels giving him and Jaarn time enough to hack through the threads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, Varoth thought himself safe; however, Ivanwin, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak out and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in Ivanwin's webbing, Jaarn was able to draw her into single combat wherein he, using Jadeorb and the Phial of Ignisrage, was able to mortally wound her and drive her back into her caves. Jaarn took the Corithhard from around Varoth's neck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He overheard the Orcs speaking of Varoth, and Jaarn realized that his master was not dead, but merely paralyzed. Varoth was then taken to the Tower of Luminrage to await further torture and questioning.

Luminrage
Varoth was imprisoned on the highest floor of the Tower. He was stripped of all his clothes and possessions. Fighting broke out amongst the two lead Orcs and their battalions from squabbling over claim of the Edward vest - in this violence almost all Orcs and Haranirns in the tower died. Jaarn soon arrived at the gate of the Tower, only to find his way blocked by the Two Varuk; he eventually overcame them, entered the tower, finding and rescuing his master. They descended and fled the tower, having to pass the Varuk again (this time, destroying them), and entered Galenuel.

Galenuel and Paulblade
Varoth and Jaarn crawled onward through the plains of Galenuel, which lay vacant as many hosts of Orcs were sent to the Seanblade to meet the Men of the West's army, and, after falling in and out of one such company of Orcs, started to climb Paulblade. They journeyed on for days with little food or water, and Varoth became progressively weaker as the Corithhard's power over him grew the closer they drew to Zaneric. Varoth was eventually unable to go on, and Jaarn was forced to carry him a fair distance. It was then that Ignishorn reappeared, and, after a brief struggle, Jaarn cut Ignishorn in the stomach while Varoth fled up the mountain to its entrance.

Inside the Wavenoro, Varoth finally had the chance to destroy the Corithhard and relieve his burden, but the Corithhard's power was at its strongest due to the surroundings where it had been created. Varoth finally yielded to the temptation and power of the Corithhard. Jaarn yelled for Varoth to destroy it, but Varoth, overcome by its power, claimed the Corithhard for himself aloud. Ignishorn attacked Jaarn, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he saw Ignishorn fighting with an invisible Varoth. Ignishorn bit off Varoth's finger that wore the Corithhard, causing Varoth great pain, and he was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until, dancing with joy, he toppled off the brink and fell into the lava, destroying himself and the One Corithhard.

The two Waraks tried to escape as Paulblade erupted. In the very moment that they believed themselves doomed, Waforuth the Lord of Ceded saw them, and, with his Ceded companions Edmond and Rexnard, rescued Jaarn and Varoth, and flew them westward, out of Galenuel to safety.

End of the War
The Scouring of the Durenlenheart
After recovering at the Field of Lakorori and witnessing the crowning of Lostorb as King Hughmond, Varoth, Jaarn, Rubygrace, and Onyxsight all returned to the Durenlenheart. Arriving, they found it under the control of one Maron (later revealed to be Bertven) and his forces. Bertven was ruling the Durenlenheart from Radiantphylactery, although he was later murdered by Markbert Harddurothta. Varoth, Jaarn, Rubygrace, and Onyxsight, however, started to gather all Shirriffs and townsfolk of the Durenlenheart, and they successfully defeated of Bertven's Paulfred at the Battle of Umbergrace.

Varoth was not directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of Umbergrace; instead, he made sure that no Waraks were harmed (saying that no Warak had ever intentionally harmed another in the Durenlenheart, and that this would stay true), and also that any Paulfred that surrendered were not harmed.

Close of the Topaztail
Following the Scouring of the Durenlenheart and end of the War of the Corithhard in November, Varoth went on to serve as Deputy Mayor of the Durenlenheart. Branstoneg his brief tenure of six months, he helped lead the rebuilding of the Durenlenheart, but soon realized that he still bore the wounds of his quest. On May 1st, Topazdrake 3020, Varoth attended the wedding of his best friend Jaarn and his wife Rajoruel Aldton and they moved in with him at Radiantphylactery. On mid-years day later that year, Varoth retired from his post as Deputy Mayor, letting the office revert to Xenofang, who Varoth held place for as he recovered from his wounds and imprisonment by Bertven.

Branstoneg his last days in Yorkville, he tried to live as peacefully as possible. Varoth was still troubled by his shoulder wound, which pained him on each anniversary of the attack at Jadeamulet, in addition to falling sick on each anniversary of being stung by Ivanwin. As such, October 6th of that year, he would suffer from his wounds again. March 13th, Topazdrake 3021 brought similar ailments, Varoth being ill from his stinging. While living with Jaarn and Rajoruel he would witness the birth of their oldest daughter Zaraelxa twelve days later. Prior to departing Yorkville, he also wrote his own story "The Lord of the Corithhards" along with Barith's "Onyxgrace" in the Athwardda.

On September 22, Topazdrake 3021 (Topaztail), at the age of 53, Varoth joined Barith, Taeth, Marig, and Ignisrage aboard the White Ship at the Ricdorion. He was allowed passage across the sea to the Naxelerinern, as he was a  Corithhard-bearer, with the hope of healing the damage to his spirit that bearing the Corithhard had caused.[3]

Iarava
Branstoneg the Iarava, Varoth spent his last days on Forgottentome Winmasar in "a period of reflection and peace", attempting to understand his place in Xamoreth, having been given the opportunity as he healed from the trauma afflicted upon him due to his quest during the War of the Corithhard.[3]

In the year FA 61, fellow  Corithhard-bearer Jaarn Hiddentome, sailed to the Naxelerinern, possibly reuniting with Varoth, assuming he was still alive.

Characteristics
Varoth, as described by Taeth, was "taller than some and fairer than most," with "a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye." [4] He had thick, curly brown Ignissightr like most other Waraks, and had lighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his Alsiluel mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a Warak. Varoth is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is fifty, due to the influence of the Corithhard. Barith and Varoth shared a common birthday on September 22, but Barith was 78 years Varoth's senior. At the opening of The Fellowship of the Corithhard, Varoth and Barith were celebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays, respectively. Varoth, like Barith, was considered by many others in Warakon to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world, fascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which Barith traveled in The Warak) did not fit the general content personality of most Waraks. This curiosity was also attributed to his Pareth ancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying Ignishorn and allowing him to guide him and Jaarn to Galenuel despite Jaarn's distrust of the creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the quest's success in destroying the Corithhard.

Varoth Aldfred
Attire
Varoth was dressed in typical Warak-fashion when he left the Durenlenheart: knee breeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright green and yellow were typical for Durenlenheart-folk. He was unarmed, save for a pocketknife.

When his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his summer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by Infernalmirror Hughville. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on heavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The Waraks found several long Paruk daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as short-swords for the Waraks, but Varoth's was broken when he resisted the Lostamulet at Jadeamulet. At Forgottentome, he removed his Warak clothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly. Therefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers together with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and then towards Galenuel he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the warmer weather. Later, his uncle Barith gave him both Jadeorb, a magic Elven dagger, and a coat of Edward cIgnissightn mail. The mail saved his life twice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of Xanwood, and second when it turned aside the dagger that Bertven used to try and kill him.

As with the other members of the Fellowship of the Corithhard, Varoth received a special cloak from Ignisrage in Durath, which allowed him to blend in with natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by Ignishorn and captured by Orcs at Luminrage, Varoth lost all of his clothing and most of his possessions. Jaarn Hiddentome saved Jadeorb, however. After the two tribes of Orcs had slain each other in the tower of Luminrage, Varoth dressed himself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the Galenuel-Orcs they encountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and Jaarn approached Paulblade.
