B_ilbo B_aggins
—T_horin to B_ilbo, in The H_obbit
B_ilbo B_aggins was a H_obbit of the S_hire in the T_hird Age. He was hired by G_andalf to aid T_horin and Company in the Quest of E_rebor, over the course of which he became a bearer of the One R_ing and fought in the B_attle of Five Armies. Upon his return home, he wrote of most of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again, and garnered great fame among H_obbits and across M_iddle-earth.

In his later years, B_ilbo took in his second-cousin-once-removed/adoptive nephew, F_rodo B_aggins, to be his heir, and eventually left the S_hire to live with the elves. At G_andalf's behest, he left F_rodo the One R_ing, and later still briefly reunited with F_rodo after he destroyed it at the end of the War of the R_ing.

Biography
Childhood
B_ilbo B_aggins was born on September 22 by S_hire-reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the T_hird Age. He was the only son of Bungo B_aggins and B_elladonna T_ook.

In H_obbiton, Bungo B_aggins constructed a spacious and luxurious H_obbit-hole for B_elladonna, which they named B_ag End. The family moved to their new home, where B_ilbo would spend much of his life.

As a young H_obbit, B_ilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The I_star wizard, G_andalf, took interest in this unusual quality in B_ilbo During his visits to the S_hire. B_ilbo would later remember G_andalf's fireworks in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. B_ilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock.

When B_ilbo's father and mother died in T_A 2926 and T_A 2934 respectively, B_ilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone in B_ag End. During this time, B_ilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.

Character
B_ilbo was a very friendly and well-mannered H_obbit fond of food, drink, a full pipe, his friends and good cheer, and was known for greeting strangers and friends with hospitality saying; "At your service and your family's." Being related to both the T_ook-clan and the B_aggins, two kins of fundamentally opposite mentalities, with the T_ooks being more fond of adventures and wandering, and the B_aggins not at all, B_ilbo at times recognized two sides within himself, his "T_ook side" and "B_aggins side". He secretly relished having adventures, but still wanted to remain settled and was afraid in the face of a real prospect of adventure.

B_ilbo seemed to be happy with his life at B_ag End, and would have been content to remain a child of his father, had adventure not come upon him. Still very afraid and wishing he had never left his H_obbit-hole, the T_ook side eventually won out, even after he returned home to his old life. Thus, his desire for another adventure never truly departed from him in his heart even into his old age. This he demonstrated in his sudden departure from B_ag End in T_A 3001.

He was also a very loving father figure to his nephew F_rodo, teaching him many things, and often regaling him with tales of his adventures.
