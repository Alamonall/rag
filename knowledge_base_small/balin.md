B_alin was a Dwarf leader, the son of F_undin, and elder brother of D_walin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied T_horin II O_akenshield on the quest to regain the L_onely Mountain.
A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of T_horin's closest friends and advisers. B_alin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of D_urin.

He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in M_oria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

Biography
Early life
B_alin was likely born in the L_onely Mountain before the coming of the dragon S_maug. He had a younger brother named D_walin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when S_maug attacked the L_onely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in D_unland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of A_zanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately T_A 2841, he accompanied T_hráin II, the father of T_horin, when he attempted to go back to the L_onely Mountain himself. T_hráin was captured and lost.

Quest of E_rebor
B_alin was part of the company assembled by T_horin O_akenshield in T_A 2941 that journeyed to the L_onely Mountain with B_ilbo B_aggins and G_andalf to defeat S_maug, and to retake the kingdom of E_rebor. He was the second Dwarf to arrive at B_ilbo's home, where, like his brother D_walin, he played a viol as big as himself. Following the meeting's conclusion and the company's initial departure to the G_reen Dragon Inn, B_alin spotted B_ilbo hurrying to reach them before they set out.

B_alin, along with his companions, underwent the journey through the T_rollshaws and L_one-lands to R_ivendell, including the encounter with the trolls Tom, Bert, and William.[3] The company rested in R_ivendell for some time, and after setting out to cross the M_isty Mountains, were captured by Orcs on the High Pass, after taking refuge from a thunderstorm.[4] With G_andalf's help, the Dwarves escaped, and subsequently B_alin was posted as a lookout when B_ilbo returned, having been separated from the company during their flight. Due to B_ilbo's usage of the One R_ing, which he had discovered in the Orc tunnels, the H_obbit crept by B_alin unnoticed, puzzling the Dwarf a great deal. Soon afterwards, the company was beset by W_args, which forced them to climb a number of pine trees until their rescue by the Great E_agles.[5]

The E_agles took them to their eyrie, and then to the C_arrock, from whence the company traveled to B_eorn's hall.[5] G_andalf decided to introduce the Dwarves by pairs so as not to overwhelm B_eorn, and B_alin and D_walin were chosen to come first. Having been welcomed by the skin-changer and given rest and provisions, the company set out to cross the forest of M_irkwood.[6] Despite having been warned to the contrary, the Dwarves eventually left the path after running low on supplies, and were soon waylaid by great spiders, which intended to eat them. B_ilbo used the R_ing to escape notice, and returned to free them. B_alin afterwards led the company in escaping from and fighting off the spiders, though the Dwarves were captured by Wood-elves, and taken to the hall of the Elvenking, T_hranduil. It was here that B_alin spoke for his companions, arguing for their release. T_hranduil refused, and imprisoned the Dwarves, until B_ilbo again rescued the company.[7]

The Dwarves came to L_ake-town,[8] and then to the L_onely Mountain. After opening the Side-door to the mountain,[9] B_alin was the only member of the company willing to go with B_ilbo some way inside. The H_obbit, after unintentionally disturbing the dragon S_maug, returned to the Dwarves, but S_maug left his lair and attempted to kill the Dwarves before turning to L_ake-town, with the intent to destroy it.[10] The dragon was there slain by Bard, and the Dwarves took possession of the mountain.[11] T_horin and B_alin, not long after, came upon the raven R_oäc, who brought word of the dragon's demise.[12]

B_alin fought in and survived the subsequent B_attle of Five Armies, which was fought against Orcs led by B_olg, after tensions with the L_ake-men and Wood-elves had run high, due to a disagreement about the division of S_maug's treasure.[13] He took up residence at the L_onely Mountain afterwards with the surviving members of the company.

Visiting B_ilbo
Seven years after the Quest for E_rebor, B_alin accompanied G_andalf to visit B_ilbo in The S_hire in T_A 2949, since the two had become good friends during their travels. He and G_andalf gave B_ilbo the news of current happenings in M_iddle-earth.[14]

Sometime afterward in the coming years before his expedition in T_A 2989, B_alin would visit B_ilbo at least one more time. D_uring this visit to The S_hire, B_alin met B_ilbo's newly adopted heir of B_ag End, F_rodo, and the young H_obbit would come to learn of some of B_alin and his Uncle's travels to the L_onely Mountain.

Expedition into M_oria

In T_A 2989,[14] B_alin led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of M_oria, hoping to re-establish Dwarven rule and to reclaim the last of the Seven R_ings of the Dwarves.[15] Though his king did not give his consent, B_alin and company went anyway. Among his numbers were fellow members of T_horin's company Ó_in and O_ri. While in M_oria, he discovered D_urin's Axe and a M_ithril helm (possibly the crown of D_urin I) and claimed them as his own. After the discovery of these items B_alin, being a descendant of the line of D_urin, claimed rulership over the Dwarven realm, taking the title Lord of M_oria (his colony being too small to be counted as a kingdom). Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been taken from T_hráin II by S_auron.

Death
After ruling as M_oria's Lord for about five years, B_alin was slain by Orcs on November 10 T_A 2994,[14] after going to look upon the M_irrormere alone. His body was recovered after a battle, and entombed in the Chamber of M_azarbul. The attempt to retake M_oria ultimately failed afterward, as the rest of his kin were eventually trapped and killed.[16] Ironically, he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in T_A 2799.[1]

Legacy

Some twenty-five years later in T_A 3019, the Fellowship of the R_ing passed through M_oria and discovered B_alin's tomb, and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the Book of M_azarbul. The knowledge of this brought much grief to B_alin's cousin G_imli, who was a member of the fellowship.[16]

Characteristics
B_alin was a discerning character, being described as the company's "look-out man": He spotted B_ilbo approaching the G_reen Dragon Inn at Bywater; he spotted the trolls' fire, and; he was the first to spot the Elves in M_irkwood. He noted that not even a mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice B_ilbo (hidden by wearing the magic r_ing) when he was lookout for the company after escaping the Orcs in the M_isty Mountains. Among the Dwarves of the company, B_alin was the second-eldest dwarf, and loosely held the position of deputy leader.

B_alin gained respect for B_ilbo's abilities, and was the only dwarf who volunteered to accompany B_ilbo down the secret passage to S_maug's chamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, B_alin was the only one known to have visited B_ilbo at B_ag End after their quest for the L_onely Mountain.
