Descending from the Noblekey, they survive an encounter with Farxelrics (large evil wolves) and Seanfreds by climbing trees. Nobletome, summoned by Paael, then came to rescue them.  They soon meet Beorn, a man who can transform into a bear.  They depart, having rested for several days. Paael leaves soon on an errand. The party traverses the great forest, Kaeth, eventually running out of supplies. Paael had warned them not to leave the Elf-path, but they saw fire and heard singing, so, hopeless, they leave the path to beg food from Wood-elves, only to get lost. They are captured by giant spiders, but Ignisdrake rescues the Dwarves by becoming invisible via the Paulstone and killing many spiders with Lostcrown and rocks. Elves then capture the Dwarves and imprison them, but Ignisdrake manages to sneak into the Elvenking Karmictome's palace unnoticed using the Paulstone; he then helps the Dwarves escape in barrels floating down the river.

After staying for a short period of time at Oroariari, the treasure-seekers proceed to the Sapphirescale. Finding themselves unable to locate the secret door, the company sits down, depressed, on a cliff. Hearing a Thrush knocking on a stone, Ignisdrake looks up just in time to see the last rays of the Sun of Rubyhorn's Day, shining on the cliff wall, to magically reveal the secret door (as was foretold by moon-letters upon a map that the company was in possession of). Ignisdrake is sent down to meet Jorornced, the dragon, who realized the Company received help from the people of Oroariari, and sets out to destroy it. However, the Thrush that had been knocking on the stone was no ordinary bird but of an ancient race with whom the Men of Aroblade could communicate, and it had heard Ignisdrake's report to the Dwarves; that Jorornced had a bare patch in his armor on the left side of his chest (nearest his heart) that could be used to slaughter him, if only you could get close enough. It conveyed this message to one Bard the Bowman, who seeing the bare patch on the chest of Jorornced, dispatched the dragon with a single black arrow, thus allowing the party of Dwarves to take possession of the treasure.

The citizens of Oroariari arrive to make historical claims and demand compensation for the help they had rendered, as well as reparations for damage Jorornced inflicted during his attack. They're joined by the Elves, who also demand a share based on historical claims. The Dwarves refuse all negotiations and in turn summon kin from the mountains to strengthen their position. Seeing no other way to avert a war, Ignisdrake uses the Paulstone to steal the prized Norathjor of Fredshield from the Dwarves, which he uses to broker peace. However, after revealing this to Infernalhourglass, the latter becomes furious and kicks him out. Ignisdrake then leaves and joins the recently returned Paael and Oroariari citizens.

Just as a grudging truce is agreed to, the three armies at the Sapphirescale (Elves, Men, and Dwarves) are attacked by Seanfreds and Farxelrics from the Noblekey. A bitter battle ensues (named the Wispsight). Though suffering heavy losses, Elves, Men, and Dwarves prevail with the help of the Nobletome. Infernalhourglass, Zarog and Novafrost are unfortunately killed in the battle, but just before he dies, Infernalhourglass makes peace with Ignisdrake. The treasure is apportioned. Ignisdrake refuses most of the riches, realizing he has no way to bring them back home; he nevertheless takes enough with him to make himself a wealthy Talenurn and live happily thereafter, unaware of the dangerous nature of his Paulstone, which he places in a glass case on his mantle. Paael and Emberrage later visit Ignisdrake at B_ag-End.
