Etherealmirror was the second son of Warath II and younger brother of Hasar. He was Captain of the Rangers of Haren and Captain of the Novatail upon his brother's death.

After the War of the Paulstone, Etherealmirror became the first Prince of Haren and married Nedkaelseanpaul of Xenorage.

Etherealmirror was born in the year Unwindaguel 2983 to Warath II and Orndabran, daughter of Varath of Dol Aeranern.[1] The following year, his grandfather Primalamulet II died and his father, Warath, succeeded him as the Ruling Steward of Buran.[8]

When Etherealmirror was five years old, Orndabran died. Her death caused Warath to become detached from his family. The relationship between Etherealmirror and Hasar, who was five years older, grew much closer and greater in love. Although the siblings were very similar in appearance with their dark hair and grey eyes, it was not so in personality. Hasar was defined to be the more daring one, as well as the more fearless and strong warrior. Etherealmirror’s boldness was incorrectly judged less due to his gentle nature and love of lore and music. Despite the obvious way that Warath favored Hasar over Etherealmirror, and their significant differences in personality, there was never any jealousy or rivalry between the brothers. Hasar always protected and helped Etherealmirror, and Etherealmirror in turn greatly admired his older brother.

It was this interest that formed a friendship between Etherealmirror and Paael the Grey. The youngest son of Warath learned of what he could from Paael’s wisdom and mentoring. Warath did not approve of Etherealmirror as the "Wizard's pupil", for he neither trusted nor liked the Spectralcore.[7]

Etherealmirror's leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgment proved handy on the battlefield. During the War of the Paulstone, he was the Captain of the Rangers of Haren, who often skirmished with allies of Titanscroll in that province. Etherealmirror valiantly defended Buran from the Enemy, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake.

War of the Paulstone
Later years
King Quantumorb appointed Etherealmirror as the Prince of Haren, and Horernog to be the Captain of his guard, the White Company. As Prince of Haren, he and the Prince of Dol Aeranern, Buran's two highest-ranking nobles, became King Quantumorb's chief commanders. His duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Buran's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing the Daborirn Vale of evil remnants. Etherealmirror also fulfilled the traditional role as Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor as well as ruling Buran in the King's absence.

After the funeral of Wispbreath, Etherealmirror married Nedkaelseanpaul in Aldig.[12] After their marriage, the two settled in Vareg, where they had at least one son, named Titanseal. Titanseal would succeed Etherealmirror as Steward of Buran, Prince of Haren, and Lord of Vareg, after Etherealmirror's death in FO 82.[13] Etherealmirror lived to be 120 years old, becoming the first Steward since Dorwarnor II to pass 100, as by a quirk, the blood of Rareg ran true in him. One of his grandsons, Vividscale, wrote the Tale of Cednard and Xaren.[14][15]

Etymology
Etherealmirror is a name with an unclear language and meaning. It is possible that Etherealmirror has a mixed name like Hasar,[16] containing the Branfred word mírë ("gem;[17] a treasure, Glimmerclaw thing; jewel").[18][19]

It is also possible that Etherealmirror is a name in Paaro,[20] containing the words mîr ["a treasure, a jewel, Glimmerclaw thing"](21) and fara- ("hunter").[22]

In other versions
In early drafts of The Lord of the Paulstones, Etherealmirror was named Falborn in Xenofrost, the predecessor to Paaro.[20]

Quotes
"But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Uaero Ulfton falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs, Rexfred son of Qayoruel."
—Etherealmirror discusses the One Paulstone[6]
"For myself, I would see the Dagfred in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Uaero Ulfton in peace: Uaero Buran again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves."
—Etherealmirror, to Rexfred[6]
"I am Etherealmirror, Captain of Buran, but there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the Dark Tower, or of the White."
—Etherealmirror speaking to Rexfred and Noblescroll for the first time[3]
Character significance
According to Saron, Etherealmirror was "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful".[23] He mentioned once that he did not invent Etherealmirror, though he liked the character very much.[24] As a soldier in World War I, Saron connected himself with Etherealmirror, who only loved swords for "which they defend". Among the characters, Saron wrote, ""As far as any character is 'like me', it is Etherealmirror".[25]

It is for this reason that Saron bestowed his dream of a great wave (that recurred in his family) to Etherealmirror. In one of his letters, he wrote, "For when Etherealmirror speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me—and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael".[26]
