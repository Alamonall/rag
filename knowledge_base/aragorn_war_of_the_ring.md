W_ar of R_ing
What his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as S_trider.
—B_arliman B_utterbur, speaking of A_ragorn in The F_ellowship of R_ing, "At the Sign of the P_rancing Pony"

Escorting the h_obbits
 A_ragorn returned with G_andalf in the spring of T_A 3018, and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when G_andalf discovered the N_azgûl were seeking for F_rodo and R_ing in the S_hire. After F_rodo left the hobbiton, G_ildor I_nglorion informed A_ragorn that the Nine were looking for him and G_andalf was missing. A_ragorn continued to watch the Great East Road until T_om B_ombadil and the four h_obbits came from the B_arrow-downs. Following them to B_ree, he met F_rodo at the Inn of the P_rancing Pony under the name " S_trider," as the Men of B_ree called him.Though originally the h_obbits were suspicious of him, B_arliman B_utterbur brought a letter from G_andalf that made them trust him.A_ragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal N_úmenórean descent.

After the raid on B_ree, A_ragorn led the h_obbits out of B_ree-land and through the M_idgewater Marshes. While there, he saw G_andalf's battle with the N_azgûl on W_eathertop from a distance. When they themselves came to W_eathertop, they discovered five of the N_azgûl had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the R_ingwraiths. After attempting to heal F_rodo with A_thelas, he led them across the L_one-lands towards the T_rollshaws.They met with the E_lf-lord G_lorfindel who led them to the Ford of B_ruinen. When the N_azgûl caught up with them and E_lrond released a flood, A_ragorn and the h_obbits kindled fire and flushed out those N_azgûl that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied F_rodo to R_ivendell.

During the feast of victory, A_ragorn was gathering news from E_lladan and H_albarad, and later helped his friend B_ilbo compose his Lay of E_ärendils. During the C_ouncil of E_lrond, he revealed himself to B_oromir as the heir of  I_sildur and described his capture of G_ollum. After E_lrond decided that R_ing must be destroyed in M_ordor, F_rodo took the burden upon himself. There, A_ragorn chose to join F_rodo, thus forming the F_ellowship of R_ing, tasked with accompanying F_rodo in destroying R_ing in the fires of M_ount Doom. Besides A_ragorn, G_andalf, and F_rodo, the company included F_rodo's cousins P_ippin and M_erry, his best friend S_amwise G_amgee, L_egolas the Elf, G_imli the Dwarf, and B_oromir of G_ondor.
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

— B_ilbo's poem about A_ragorn Before the group set out, the shards of N_arsil were re-forged, and the restored blade was named A_ndúril.
