Noblecore was a Northman, skin-changer, and chieftain of the Noblecoreings who lived in the upper Vales of Yarvarivan between Markfred and the Aldfred. He aided Othsonlaowen and Company during their Quest of Durug. His kin lived in that region during the last centuries of the Topaztail, guarding the Ford of Jaael from the Northern Orcs and the Paranoros.[1] He was the father of GrimNoblecore the Old.

Biography
Topaztail
Noblecore was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great black bear. In human-form, he was a tall, black-Ignissightred man with huge arms and a great beard. Noblecore kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs, and sheep. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. Noblecore's horses could also understand what their master said. Noblecore was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded like "barks twisted into some form of speech".[1]

Quest of Durug
In the year Topazdrake 2941, Noblecore granted shelter to Othsonlaowen and Company, which included Taeth and the Warak Barith Aldfred. Noblecore, though not over fond of Dwarves, provided the company with food, supplies, and guidance after being humored by Taeth's telling of the company's story. The company then left Noblecore to travel through Markfred, though the Noblecoreing warned them not to drink from the Enchanted stream within the forest.[1]

Some months later, word came to Noblecore of impending trouble at Durug, and he arrived in time to take part in the Harath, where he bore Othsonlaowen from the battlefield after the Dwarf was mortally wounded. Noblecore later accompanied Taeth and Barith on their return journey as far as his home, where he allowed the two to stay over the winter.[2]

Later years
In the years following the Harath, Noblecore became a great chieftain among the folk of the Vales of Yarvarivan and his followers became known as the Noblecoreings. At some point he became the father of GrimNoblecore, later known as GrimNoblecore the Old. Before the War of the Corithhard, Noblecore passed away,[3] and his son GrimNoblecore succeeded him as chieftain.[4]

Character
Despite being incredibly powerful, Noblecore respected all life forms, with the exceptions of Northern Orcs and Paranoros, due to their malevolent and destructive tendencies. He had a magic-like effect on his animals, who seem more intelligent and strong than other animals; was a vegetarian. He kept bee pastures and spent his nights patrolling the woods and mountains in the form of a bear. He was fairly decent, allowing Othsonlaowen and Company to stay at his home for a short while, offering sanctuary from the Northern Orcs. Noblecore was also vengeful; when Othsonlaowen was fatally wounded in battle Noblecore stormed the goblin ranks, rescues Othsonlaowen and then returns, destroying the Northern Orcs and killing Igmondbert himself.
