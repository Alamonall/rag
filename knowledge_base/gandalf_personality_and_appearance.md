Personality
G_andalf is often described in The Lord of the R_ings as quick to anger, and equally quick to laugh.[40] His deep wisdom and compassion clearly derived from the patience he learned in V_alinor, just as his care for all creatures of good will must have come from his strong sense of compassion for the weak. Both his patience and sense of kindness were revealed again and again, extending even to the servants of his enemies.

Keen observers of G_andalf often detected a veiled power, usually revealed in his eyes, which appeared deep and wise. He was alternately affectionate and brusque; he often surprised others with his bluntness when time was of the essence. G_andalf consistently upbraided foolish behaviour, but also richly rewarded those who acted with good intentions.

H_obbits appealed to him more than to the other Wizards, and he went often to the S_hire for respite from errands. His attachment was likely because the S_hire was of more bliss and peaceful than other inhabited realms of M_iddle-earth.

Appearance

G_andalf is described as an old man with a pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of the hat. As one of the I_stari, his body of flesh was old in its appearance from the beginning, and though immortal and effectively ageless, G_andalf would often be noted to seemingly age further as time passed.

After he is resurrected, the change of his signature colour from grey to white is significant, for he was sent back to replace the corrupted head of the O_rder of Wizards and leader of the W_hite C_ouncil S_aruman as the Chief of the O_rder of Wizards. In the book, he says that he has himself become what S_aruman should have been.

C_írdan the Shipwright seemed to have foreseen this, for he entrusted the care of N_arya, the R_ing of Fire (one of the Three R_ings of the Elves) to G_andalf rather than S_aruman.
