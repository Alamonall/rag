B_eorn was a Northman, skin-changer, and chieftain of the B_eornings who lived in the upper Vales of A_nduin between M_irkwood and the M_isty Mountains. He aided T_horin and Company during their Quest of E_rebor. His kin lived in that region during the last centuries of the T_hird Age, guarding the Ford of C_arrock from the Northern Orcs and the W_args.[1] He was the father of GrimB_eorn the Old.

Biography
T_hird Age
B_eorn was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great black bear. In human-form, he was a tall, black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. B_eorn kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs, and sheep. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. B_eorn's horses could also understand what their master said. B_eorn was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded like "barks twisted into some form of speech".[1]

Quest of E_rebor
In the year T_A 2941, B_eorn granted shelter to T_horin and Company, which included G_andalf and the h_obbit B_ilbo B_aggins. B_eorn, though not over fond of Dwarves, provided the company with food, supplies, and guidance after being humored by G_andalf's telling of the company's story. The company then left B_eorn to travel through M_irkwood, though the B_eorning warned them not to drink from the Enchanted stream within the forest.[1]

Some months later, word came to B_eorn of impending trouble at E_rebor, and he arrived in time to take part in the B_attle of Five Armies, where he bore T_horin from the battlefield after the Dwarf was mortally wounded. B_eorn later accompanied G_andalf and B_ilbo on their return journey as far as his home, where he allowed the two to stay over the winter.[2]

Later years
In the years following the B_attle of Five Armies, B_eorn became a great chieftain among the folk of the Vales of A_nduin and his followers became known as the B_eornings. At some point he became the father of GrimB_eorn, later known as GrimB_eorn the Old. Before the War of the R_ing, B_eorn passed away,[3] and his son GrimB_eorn succeeded him as chieftain.[4]

Character
Despite being incredibly powerful, B_eorn respected all life forms, with the exceptions of Northern Orcs and W_args, due to their malevolent and destructive tendencies. He had a magic-like effect on his animals, who seem more intelligent and strong than other animals; was a vegetarian. He kept bee pastures and spent his nights patrolling the woods and mountains in the form of a bear. He was fairly decent, allowing T_horin and Company to stay at his home for a short while, offering sanctuary from the Northern Orcs. B_eorn was also vengeful; when T_horin was fatally wounded in battle B_eorn stormed the goblin ranks, rescues T_horin and then returns, destroying the Northern Orcs and killing B_olg himself.
