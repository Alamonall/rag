The Breaking of the Fellowship

The Fellowship continued their journey south to P_arth Galen. There, B_oromir, a G_ondorian and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince F_rodo to bring the R_ing to M_inas T_irith and regroup from there. When the h_obbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, B_oromir followed him. Seeing that F_rodo did not intend to take the suggested course of action, B_oromir tried to take the R_ing from him by force.

F_rodo put on the R_ing and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across M_iddle-earth and the Eye of S_auron searching for him as he traveled. He was nearly spotted, but the Dark Lord's attention was drawn away by a resurrected G_andalf.

Taking off the R_ing, he decided to take the item to M_ordor alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend S_amwise G_amgee, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide F_rodo. F_rodo gave in to S_am's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have S_am's company.

The two h_obbits continued toward M_ordor, dividing the Fellowship. Meanwhile, B_oromir was killed by U_ruk-archers while defending M_erry and P_ippin; the two young h_obbits were then captured by U_ruk-hai, and were to be taken to I_sengard. Instead of following S_amwise and F_rodo to M_ordor, the Three Hunters, A_ragorn, L_egolas and G_imli, decided it more important to rescue M_erry and P_ippin from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.

E_myn Muil

After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at A_mon Hen, F_rodo and S_am tried to navigate through the winding paths and razor sharp rocks of the E_myn Muil. After getting lost several times, they were found by G_ollum, who at first tried to take the One R_ing, but was captured by S_am (with F_rodo's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. F_rodo, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay G_ollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. G_ollum then led them out of the maze and into the D_ead Marshes.

The D_ead Marshes

The D_ead Marshes lay to the south of E_myn Muil, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as Orcs marched for miles around, although G_ollum had secretly discovered a path when traveling. He led F_rodo and S_am on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.

Soon after F_rodo, S_amwise, and G_ollum entered the D_ead Marshes, a N_azgûl flew over them on a B_lack Wing, looking for the R_ing. G_ollum had led the two h_obbits to a safe place that they could hide in.
