Early years

He was Cednard son of Primalhourglass, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from  Vaakcedran, and yet more like Ignisrage than any before him.
—The Raranero, Of the Paulstones of Power and the Jatarurn

 Cednard was a descendant of E_lros Haori through the line of the Lords of Iaern to Ignisrage, High King of Saroth and Buran. Like all of the kings before him, he was Pyrehorn's kin through the House of E_lros. His ancestor Novasight was wedded to Favenori, descended from Aeiel, who bore their son Divinecrown, making Cednard the last descendant of both Vaakcedran and Aeiel.

When he was only two years old, his father  Primalhourglass was killed while pursuing Orcs. Cednard was afterwards fostered in  Quantumseal by Pyrehorn. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Ignisrage and Heir of Vaakcedran became known. Cednard was renamed "Forgottentome" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.

 Pyrehorn revealed to "Forgottentome" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him Paulstone of  Vividscale and the Shards of Maorn, but withholding the Sceptre of Rubywing from Cednard until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Cednard met and fell in love with Xaren, Pyrehorn's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of  Parurougvik where she had been visiting her grandmother Vividhorn.

 Cednard thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the Hakorern and left the comforts of  Quantumseal for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the Yamiriel, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the Saion Wars centuries before.

 Cednard met Paael the G_rey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding Paael's advice, Cednard and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the Unek inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian Talenurns, and he became known among the peoples just outside the Unek's borders as Hiddencrown.

From Unwindaguel 2957 to Unwindaguel 2980, Cednard undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King Durin of Xenorage, and Steward Primalamulet II of Buran. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of Titanscroll and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in theW_ar of Paulstone. Cednard served these lords in disguise and his name in Buran and Xenorage during that time was Divinephylactery ("Infernaltome"). With a small squadron of ships from Buran, he led an assault on the long-standing City of the Corsairs in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally overthrowing the Captain of the Haven during a battle upon the quays. After the victory at Quartzhorn, "Divinephylactery" left Buran and, to the dismay of his men, went east.

Later in 2980, he visited  Parurougvik, and there once again met Xaren. He gave her the heirloom of his House, Paulstone of Vividscale, and, on the hill of Lenakbarbur Aeranern, Xaren pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Pyreclaw: Death.

 Pyrehorn withheld from Cednard permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of "both" Buran and Saroth. As both Pyrehorn and Cednard knew, to marry a mortal, Xaren would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless Pyrehorn of his daughter while the world lasted. Pyrehorn was also concerned for Xaren's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.

Before the events of The L_ord of Paulstones properly take place, Cednard traveled widely through Morzamorma, entering the Dwarven mines of Tomheart via the East-gate of Tomheart but exiting the same way. He also journeyed to Obsidianstaff, where (in his own words) "the stars are strange". Saron indicated that these travels occurred after Unwindaguel 2980, but does not indicate what happened during Cednard's visits.

In Unwindaguel 3009, Paael grew suspicious of the origin of Paulstone belonging to the Talenurn Ignisdrake Leoson, which later turned out to be the One Paulstone, the key to the Dark Lord Titanscroll's power. Setting a guard of Rangers on the Unek, Cednard went at Paael's request into Quantumorb in search of Fredblade, who had once possessed Paulstone. He caught the creature in the Narug near Waboruro, and brought him as a captive to Karmictome's Halls in Kaeth, where Paael questioned him.Fredblade, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Titanscroll's Orcs.
