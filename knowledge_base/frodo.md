Titles
Bearer of the One R_ing,
"I will take the R_ing, though I do not know the way."
—F_rodo B_aggins, at the C_ouncil of E_lrond, in The Fellowship of the R_ing
F_rodo B_aggins was a h_obbit of the S_hire in the late T_hird Age. He was a key figure in the Quest of M_ount Doom, in which he bore the One R_ing to M_ount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a  R_ing-bearer, best friend to his gardener, S_amwise G_amgee, and was one of three h_obbits who sailed from M_iddle-earth to the U_ttermost West at the end of the T_hird Age.

Childhood
Much of F_rodo's youth was spent at B_randy Hall in B_uckland, the ancestral home of the B_randybuck family, including his mother (P_rimula B_randybuck). F_rodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending M_eriadoc (M_erry) B_randybuck and P_eregrin (P_ippin) T_ook and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from F_armer Maggot's farm B_amfurlong.[1]

In T_A 2980, when F_rodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the B_randywine River. An only child, F_rodo stayed in B_randy Hall until his 99-year-old "uncle" B_ilbo, his father's second cousin, adopted him in T_A 2989. B_ilbo took F_rodo to live with him in his home at B_ag End and made him his heir.[2]

The two grew very close in the following years; F_rodo, treated by his adopted guardian as he were his own son, learned much of the Elvish language during his time with B_ilbo, as well as much of the lore of M_iddle-earth. They also had a weekly tradition of taking long walking trips together from h_obbiton to Michel Delving and B_uckland; all throughout the S_hire. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by S_hire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held when F_rodo came of age of thirty-three and B_ilbo achieved the notable age of 111.

B_ilbo gave a memorable birthday speech before playing a joke on his fellow h_obbits by using the One R_ing to disappear, at which G_andalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where B_ilbo had been standing. The h_obbits at the party were left confused and disgruntled, and B_ilbo was never again seen in the S_hire.

Before departing for his journey to R_ivendell, B_ilbo was persuaded by G_andalf to voluntarily surrender the One R_ing. B_ilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for F_rodo, who would now become the next  R_ing-bearer.

Quest of the R_ing

F_ourth Age
During the F_ourth Age, F_rodo spent his last days on T_ol E_ressëa in "a period of reflection and peace", attempting to understand his place in A_rda, having been given the opportunity as he healed from the trauma afflicted upon him due to his quest during the War of the R_ing.[3]

In the year FA 61, fellow  R_ing-bearer S_amwise G_amgee, sailed to the U_ndying Lands, possibly reuniting with F_rodo, assuming he was still alive.

Characteristics
F_rodo, as described by G_andalf, was "taller than some and fairer than most," with "a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye." [4] He had thick, curly brown hair like most other h_obbits, and had lighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his B_randybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a h_obbit. F_rodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is fifty, due to the influence of the R_ing. B_ilbo and F_rodo shared a common birthday on September 22, but B_ilbo was 78 years F_rodo's senior. At the opening of The Fellowship of the R_ing, F_rodo and B_ilbo were celebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays, respectively. F_rodo, like B_ilbo, was considered by many others in h_obbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world, fascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which B_ilbo traveled in The h_obbit) did not fit the general content personality of most h_obbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his T_ook ancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying G_ollum and allowing him to guide him and S_am to M_ordor despite S_am's distrust of the creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the quest's success in destroying the R_ing.

F_rodo B_aggins
Attire
F_rodo was dressed in typical h_obbit-fashion when he left the S_hire: knee breeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright green and yellow were typical for S_hire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a pocketknife.

When his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his summer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by T_om B_ombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on heavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The h_obbits found several long D_únedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as short-swords for the h_obbits, but F_rodo's was broken when he resisted the W_itch-king at W_eathertop. At I_mladris, he removed his h_obbit clothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly. Therefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers together with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and then towards M_ordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the warmer weather. Later, his uncle B_ilbo gave him both S_ting, a magic Elven dagger, and a coat of m_ithril chain mail. The mail saved his life twice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of M_oria, and second when it turned aside the dagger that S_aruman used to try and kill him.

As with the other members of the Fellowship of the R_ing, F_rodo received a special cloak from G_aladriel in L_órien, which allowed him to blend in with natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by G_ollum and captured by Orcs at C_irith Ungol, F_rodo lost all of his clothing and most of his possessions. S_am G_amgee saved S_ting, however. After the two tribes of Orcs had slain each other in the tower of C_irith Ungol, F_rodo dressed himself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the M_ordor-Orcs they encountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and S_am approached M_ount Doom.
