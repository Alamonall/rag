C_ouncil of E_lrond
After his healing, F_rodo was summoned to a great C_ouncil that E_lrond had organized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of M_iddle-earth discussed the history of the R_ings of Power and decided that the One R_ing must be destroyed. As the R_ing was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the R_ing on this mission, until F_rodo bravely volunteered to take the R_ing to M_ordor and cast it into the fires of M_ount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join F_rodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the R_ing.

The Fellowship consisted of F_rodo, S_amwise, M_erry, P_ippin, A_ragorn, G_andalf, B_oromir of Gondor, L_egolas of the Woodland Realm, and G_imli of the Lonely Mountain. Before leaving R_ivendell, B_ilbo gave F_rodo his dwarf-made coat of m_ithril mail and his elven blade S_ting. The m_ithril coat had been given to B_ilbo by T_horin O_akenshield during the events of The h_obbit, and S_ting had been taken by B_ilbo from a T_rolls lair. On December 25, the Fellowship of the R_ing departed from R_ivendell and headed south.

M_oria

After an attack by White Wolves in E_region, on January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the M_isty Mountains (specifically the Pass of C_aradhras), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of M_oria at the urging of G_imli.

Some days in into their dangerous trek through M_oria, the Fellowship entered the Chamber of M_azarbul, and was attacked by Orcs and a c_ave-troll. F_rodo helped to defeat the troll before he was stabbed by an Orc captain, his m_ithril-shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship then ran from there to the Bridge of Khazad-dum, at which G_andalf dueled Durin's Bane and fell. Once outside M_oria, while the Fellowship was grieving, G_imli took F_rodo and S_am to look upon the M_irrormere, even in their great hurry.

L_othlórien

Deeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of L_othlórien, where they met the Lady G_aladriel and Lord Celeborn. G_aladriel showed F_rodo a vision of the future in her Mirror. F_rodo offered her the One R_ing, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the Elves. Before the Fellowship departed from L_othlórien, G_aladriel gave each member a gift. To F_rodo, she gave a phial with the light of the star E_ärendil captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and boats for their voyage down the A_nduin River.
