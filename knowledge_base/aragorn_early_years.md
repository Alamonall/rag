Early years

He was A_ragorn son of A_rathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from  I_sildur, and yet more like E_lendil than any before him.
—The S_ilmarillion, Of the R_ings of Power and the T_hird Age

 A_ragorn was a descendant of E_lros T_ar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of A_ndúnië to E_lendil, High King of A_rnor and G_ondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was E_lrond's kin through the House of E_lros. His ancestor A_rvedui was wedded to F_íriel, descended from A_nárion, who bore their son A_ranarth, making A_ragorn the last descendant of both I_sildur and A_nárion.

When he was only two years old, his father  A_rathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs. A_ragorn was afterwards fostered in  R_ivendell by E_lrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of E_lendil and Heir of I_sildur became known. A_ragorn was renamed "E_stel" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.

 E_lrond revealed to "E_stel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him R_ing of  B_arahir and the Shards of N_arsil, but withholding the Sceptre of A_nnúminas from A_ragorn until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that A_ragorn met and fell in love with A_rwen, E_lrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of  L_othlórien where she had been visiting her grandmother G_aladriel.

 A_ragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the D_únedain and left the comforts of  R_ivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the R_angers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the A_ngmar Wars centuries before.

 A_ragorn met G_andalf the G_rey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding G_andalf's advice, A_ragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the S_hire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian h_obbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the S_hire's borders as S_trider.

From T_A 2957 to T_A 2980, A_ragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King T_hengel of R_ohan, and Steward E_cthelion II of G_ondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of S_auron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in theW_ar of R_ing. A_ragorn served these lords in disguise and his name in G_ondor and R_ohan during that time was T_horongil ("E_agle of the Star"). With a small squadron of ships from G_ondor, he led an assault on the long-standing City of the Corsairs in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally overthrowing the Captain of the Haven during a battle upon the quays. After the victory at U_mbar, "T_horongil" left G_ondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.

Later in 2980, he visited  L_othlórien, and there once again met A_rwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, R_ing of B_arahir, and, on the hill of C_erin A_mroth, A_rwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of I_lúvatar: Death.

 E_lrond withheld from A_ragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of "both" G_ondor and A_rnor. As both E_lrond and A_ragorn knew, to marry a mortal, A_rwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless E_lrond of his daughter while the world lasted. E_lrond was also concerned for A_rwen's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.

Before the events of The L_ord of R_ings properly take place, A_ragorn traveled widely through M_iddle-earth, entering the Dwarven mines of M_oria via the East-gate of M_oria but exiting the same way. He also journeyed to H_arad, where (in his own words) "the stars are strange". T_olkien indicated that these travels occurred after T_A 2980, but does not indicate what happened during A_ragorn's visits.

In T_A 3009, G_andalf grew suspicious of the origin of R_ing belonging to the h_obbit B_ilbo B_aggins, which later turned out to be the One R_ing, the key to the Dark Lord S_auron's power. Setting a guard of Rangers on the S_hire, A_ragorn went at G_andalf's request into R_hovanion in search of G_ollum, who had once possessed R_ing. He caught the creature in the D_ead Marshes near M_ordor, and brought him as a captive to T_hranduil's Halls in M_irkwood, where G_andalf questioned him.G_ollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of S_auron's Orcs.
