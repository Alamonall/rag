Bearer of the One R_ing,
"I will take the R_ing, though I do not know the way."
—F_rodo B_aggins, at the Council of E_lrond, in The Fellowship of the R_ing
F_rodo B_aggins was a h_obbit of the S_hire in the late T_hird Age. He was a key figure in the Quest of M_ount Doom, in which he bore the One R_ing to M_ount Doom, where it was destroyed. He was a  R_ing-bearer, best friend to his gardener, S_amwise G_amgee, and was one of three h_obbits who sailed from M_iddle-earth to the Uttermost West at the end of the T_hird Age.

Childhood
Much of F_rodo's youth was spent at B_randy Hall in B_uckland, the ancestral home of the B_randybuck family, including his mother (P_rimula B_randybuck). F_rodo was known as something of a rascal, befriending M_eriadoc (M_erry) B_randybuck and P_eregrin (P_ippin) T_ook and causing trouble wherever they went. They would often steal mushrooms from F_armer Maggot's farm B_amfurlong.[1]

In T_A 2980, when F_rodo was only 12 years old, his parents drowned in a boating accident on the B_randywine River. An only child, F_rodo stayed in B_randy Hall until his 99-year-old "uncle" B_ilbo, his father's second cousin, adopted him in T_A 2989. B_ilbo took F_rodo to live with him in his home at B_ag End and made him his heir.[2]

The two grew very close in the following years; F_rodo, treated by his adopted guardian as he were his own son, learned much of the Elvish language during his time with B_ilbo, as well as much of the lore of M_iddle-earth. They also had a weekly tradition of taking long walking trips together from h_obbiton to Michel Delving and B_uckland; all throughout the S_hire. The two shared the same birthday, September 22 by S_hire Reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), and a party of special magnificence was held when F_rodo came of age of thirty-three and B_ilbo achieved the notable age of 111.

B_ilbo gave a memorable birthday speech before playing a joke on his fellow h_obbits by using the One R_ing to disappear, at which G_andalf quickly reacted and used his staff to create a blinding flash where B_ilbo had been standing. The h_obbits at the party were left confused and disgruntled, and B_ilbo was never again seen in the S_hire.

Before departing for his journey to R_ivendell, B_ilbo was persuaded by G_andalf to voluntarily surrender the One R_ing. B_ilbo left it on the fireplace mantel with a note for F_rodo, who would now become the next  R_ing-bearer.

Coming of age & flight from the S_hire
After the party finished, F_rodo returned home and discovered that he was now the master of B_ag End and the recipient of B_ilbo's magic R_ing. G_andalf, ever more curious about the R_ing's origin, power, and purpose (but not yet positive it was the One R_ing), advised the young h_obbit against the using the R_ing. For the next seventeen years, F_rodo complied with the wizard's request and hid the R_ing in a safe place. However, on April 12, 3018, G_andalf returned to B_ag End and warned F_rodo that the R_ing was actually the One R_ing, which the Dark Lord S_auron needed to rule over M_iddle-earth. Realizing that S_auron would be looking for the R_ing, G_andalf advised the h_obbit to secretly follow B_ilbo's journey to R_ivendell.

After F_rodo's discussion with G_andalf, a rumor started that he was running out of money. This rumor, though not begun by F_rodo, was encouraged by him. M_erry helped F_rodo to purchase a small house at C_rickhollow. With the exception of his gardener S_am G_amgee, who had agreed to accompany him to R_ivendell, F_rodo told the other h_obbits of the S_hire that he intended to move to B_uckland. He sold his home to the S_ackville-B_agginses, and, on the September 23, 3018, the day after his fiftieth birthday, F_rodo left from B_ag End, taking with him S_am and P_ippin. They left in the early morning for B_ree, and just in time, as S_auron's most powerful servants, the nine N_azgûl, had entered the S_hire dressed as B_lack Riders searching for a h_obbit with the name of B_aggins.

To B_ree
F_rodo was nearly captured by a B_lack Rider on the road, but was saved by G_ildor I_nglorion of the House of F_inrod, whom he asked for advice. Leaving the roads to cut across country, F_rodo and S_am reached F_armer Maggot's farm, who helped them to evade the Riders. Meeting M_erry at B_ucklebury Ferry, they saw a Rider tracking them from the bank they'd departed from. On arrival at C_rickhollow, F_rodo found that M_erry and P_ippin already knew about his "secret" journey. F_rodo was left with no alternative but to bring the two youngsters with him. They cut through the Old Forest and the Barrow-downs in hopes of losing the B_lack Riders, which did succeed. They met other troubles in those places though, at the hands of Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wights, but were rescued twice by T_om B_ombadil, a mysterious being who dwelt in a glade in the middle of the Old Forest.

S_trider

In B_ree, the h_obbits stayed at The P_rancing Pony, an old inn. F_rodo went by the name of Mr U_nderhill, attempting to raise as little suspicion as possible. When he noticed a mysteriously cloaked Man sitting in the shadows and smoking a long-stemmed pipe, F_rodo asked the innkeeper, B_arliman B_utterbur, who the man was. The innkeeper referred to the man, a Ranger, as S_trider.

That night, B_lack Riders arrived in B_ree and attacked the inn in search of F_rodo and the One R_ing, but S_trider had managed to hide the h_obbits from them in time. Having gained their trust, S_trider introduced himself as A_ragorn to F_rodo and the others, to whom he also revealed the backstory of the black riders, also called N_azgûl or R_ingwraiths. With a pony named Bill that the h_obbits had acquired at B_ree, S_trider led F_rodo and his companions into the Wild. A_ragorn would be their guide to R_ivendell, and he would lead them through the Midgewater Marshes and to the hill of W_eathertop.

W_eathertop
On the night of October the sixth, the h_obbits were attacked by five of the nine R_ingwraiths at W_eathertop. In the presence of the N_azgûl, F_rodo made the mistake of putting on the R_ing. He was able to resist their attempt to take him by drawing his sword and invoking the name of one of the V_alar, E_lbereth G_ilthoniel. Unfortunately, the leader of the N_azgûl, the W_itch-king of A_ngmar, stabbed F_rodo in the shoulder (he would have stabbed his heart) with a M_orgul-knife. If it had caught him in the heart, F_rodo would have become like the N_azgûl, only weaker and under their control. the R_ingwraiths were driven away by the appearance of A_ragorn and his martial skill; also because he had torches, one of their few weaknesses.

Though A_ragorn was a skilled healer, he could not heal F_rodo's wound. A fragment of the R_ingwraith's blade remained in F_rodo's flesh, where it continued to move towards his heart. Near death (or worse), F_rodo was rescued by G_lorfindel, an E_lf-lord, who put the injured h_obbit upon his horse A_sfaloth. They were found and pursued by the N_azgûl, as G_lorfindel rode and bore F_rodo swiftly to the Ford of B_ruinen, at the entrance to the valley of R_ivendell. Once they had crossed the River B_ruinen, the Nine R_ingwraiths behind them demanded F_rodo give up the R_ing, but F_rodo refused. Subsequently, the R_ingwraiths entered the river and were washed away in a flood called up by E_lrond.

F_rodo was soon healed in R_ivendell by E_lrond, who knew the wound would not ultimately leave him, as it was both spiritual and physical. On the 24th of October 3018, F_rodo awoke in R_ivendell and was reunited with B_ilbo, G_andalf, A_ragorn, S_am, M_erry, and P_ippin. Although E_lrond had healed his wound, it continued to ail him yearly for as long as he lived in M_iddle-earth.

Quest of the R_ing
Council of E_lrond

After his healing, F_rodo was summoned to a great Council that E_lrond had organized. Representatives of all the Free Peoples of M_iddle-earth discussed the history of the R_ings of Power and decided that the One R_ing must be destroyed. As the R_ing was shown and tempers flared, argument broke out as to who should carry the R_ing on this mission, until F_rodo bravely volunteered to take the R_ing to M_ordor and cast it into the fires of M_ount Doom. A member of each of the Free Peoples offered to join F_rodo in his quest, thus forming the Fellowship of the R_ing.

The Fellowship consisted of F_rodo, S_amwise, M_erry, P_ippin, A_ragorn, G_andalf, B_oromir of Gondor, L_egolas of the Woodland Realm, and G_imli of the Lonely Mountain. Before leaving R_ivendell, B_ilbo gave F_rodo his dwarf-made coat of m_ithril mail and his elven blade S_ting. The m_ithril coat had been given to B_ilbo by T_horin O_akenshield during the events of The h_obbit, and S_ting had been taken by B_ilbo from a T_rolls lair. On December 25, the Fellowship of the R_ing departed from R_ivendell and headed south.

M_oria

After an attack by White Wolves in E_region, on January 11, 3019, the Fellowship attempted to cross the M_isty Mountains (specifically the Pass of C_aradhras), but were unable to due to a snowstorm. They instead traveled through the underground city of M_oria at the urging of G_imli.

Some days in into their dangerous trek through M_oria, the Fellowship entered the Chamber of M_azarbul, and was attacked by Orcs and a c_ave-troll. F_rodo helped to defeat the troll before he was stabbed by an Orc captain, his m_ithril-shirt saving him from a deadly blow. The Fellowship then ran from there to the Bridge of Khazad-dum, at which G_andalf dueled Durin's Bane and fell. Once outside M_oria, while the Fellowship was grieving, G_imli took F_rodo and S_am to look upon the M_irrormere, even in their great hurry.

L_othlórien

Deeply grieved by their loss, the Fellowship journeyed to the Elven kingdom of L_othlórien, where they met the Lady G_aladriel and Lord Celeborn. G_aladriel showed F_rodo a vision of the future in her Mirror. F_rodo offered her the One R_ing, but she resisted the temptation to take it, passing the test that was laid before her, and accepting the diminishing of the power of the Elves. Before the Fellowship departed from L_othlórien, G_aladriel gave each member a gift. To F_rodo, she gave a phial with the light of the star E_ärendil captured inside; this gift would prove hugely important later on in the quest. They were also provided with elven way-bread, other supplies, and boats for their voyage down the Anduin River.

The Breaking of the Fellowship

The Fellowship continued their journey south to P_arth Galen. There, B_oromir, a G_ondorian and a member of the Fellowship, attempted to convince F_rodo to bring the R_ing to M_inas T_irith and regroup from there. When the h_obbit asked for an hour alone to consider his options, B_oromir followed him. Seeing that F_rodo did not intend to take the suggested course of action, B_oromir tried to take the R_ing from him by force.

F_rodo put on the R_ing and escaped to the Seat of Seeing, where he watched as war brewed across M_iddle-earth and the Eye of S_auron searching for him as he traveled. He was nearly spotted, but the Dark Lord's attention was drawn away by a resurrected G_andalf.

Taking off the R_ing, he decided to take the item to M_ordor alone, without telling the other members of the Fellowship. However, he was joined by his friend S_amwise G_amgee, who felt it was necessary that he should protect and guide F_rodo. F_rodo gave in to S_am's protests, and although reluctant to lead anyone else to his fate, was glad to have S_am's company.

The two h_obbits continued toward M_ordor, dividing the Fellowship. Meanwhile, B_oromir was killed by U_ruk-archers while defending M_erry and P_ippin; the two young h_obbits were then captured by U_ruk-hai, and were to be taken to I_sengard. Instead of following S_amwise and F_rodo to M_ordor, the Three Hunters, A_ragorn, L_egolas and G_imli, decided it more important to rescue M_erry and P_ippin from their captors. The breaking of the Fellowship was now complete.

E_myn Muil

After leaving what remained of the Fellowship at A_mon Hen, F_rodo and S_am tried to navigate through the winding paths and razor sharp rocks of the E_myn Muil. After getting lost several times, they were found by G_ollum, who at first tried to take the One R_ing, but was captured by S_am (with F_rodo's help) and tied up with the Elven rope. F_rodo, now pitying the creature, decided not to slay G_ollum, but forced him to swear an oath of servitude to the master of the precious. G_ollum then led them out of the maze and into the D_ead Marshes.

The D_ead Marshes

The D_ead Marshes lay to the south of E_myn Muil, and were just as disorienting, if not more so. There was thought to be no route through the marshes, as Orcs marched for miles around, although G_ollum had secretly discovered a path when traveling. He led F_rodo and S_am on a safe pathway through the marshes, warning them not to follow what seemed like small torches in the water.

Soon after F_rodo, S_amwise, and G_ollum entered the D_ead Marshes, a N_azgûl flew over them on a B_lack Wing, looking for the R_ing. G_ollum had led the two h_obbits to a safe place that they could hide in.

I_thilien
G_ollum led the two h_obbits to the B_lack Gate of M_ordor, as F_rodo had desired, but stopped the h_obbits from passing its doors, as the danger was too great. He then explained about a secret way into M_ordor, 'Up the stairs and through the tunnel'. The h_obbits once again found themselves being led by G_ollum. After venturing into I_thilien, and witnessing a skirmish between a company of Haradrim warriors (along with O_liphaunts) and Rangers from Gondor, they were apprehended by the Ranger's captain, F_aramir. When the skirmish had ended, F_aramir blindfolded the R_ing-bearer and his companions and led them to H_enneth Annûn, the Window on the West. Upon much interrogation, S_am foolishly misspoke, and gave away that F_rodo was indeed carrying the One R_ing. Realizing the importance of the quest, F_aramir proved his quality, unlike his brother, B_oromir, and let the R_ing-bearer go free, resupplying the h_obbits with food for their journey. Later, G_ollum was captured in the Forbidden Pool and forcibly taken into the hidden lair. F_rodo begged for his safety, and he was not killed, although the rift between master and servant had once again begun to open.

M_inas M_orgul and S_helob's Lair
G_ollum led the h_obbits past the lair of the W_itch-king of A_ngmar, M_inas M_orgul, and up the Stairs of C_irith Ungol into 'The Tunnel'. When they arrived at the top though, they were abandoned by G_ollum, causing them to realize that G_ollum had betrayed them. They cautiously traveled through the tunnel, and managed to get to the end only to find their way barred by S_helob's great web. Whilst attempting to cut through the webbing, F_rodo bravely stood up to S_helob and forced her back further into the tunnels giving him and S_am time enough to hack through the threads and escape. Upon escaping the tunnels, F_rodo thought himself safe; however, S_helob, through one of her many tunnels, managed to sneak out and jab him with her stinger. As he was being encased in S_helob's webbing, S_am was able to draw her into single combat wherein he, using S_ting and the Phial of G_aladriel, was able to mortally wound her and drive her back into her caves. S_am took the R_ing from around F_rodo's neck upon hearing Orcish voices, and hid behind some nearby rocks. He overheard the Orcs speaking of F_rodo, and S_am realized that his master was not dead, but merely paralyzed. F_rodo was then taken to the Tower of C_irith Ungol to await further torture and questioning.

C_irith Ungol
F_rodo was imprisoned on the highest floor of the Tower. He was stripped of all his clothes and possessions. Fighting broke out amongst the two lead Orcs and their battalions from squabbling over claim of the m_ithril vest - in this violence almost all Orcs and U_ruks in the tower died. S_am soon arrived at the gate of the Tower, only to find his way blocked by the Two W_atchers; he eventually overcame them, entered the tower, finding and rescuing his master. They descended and fled the tower, having to pass the W_atchers again (this time, destroying them), and entered M_ordor.

M_ordor and M_ount Doom
F_rodo and S_am crawled onward through the plains of M_ordor, which lay vacant as many hosts of Orcs were sent to the B_lack Gate to meet the Men of the West's army, and, after falling in and out of one such company of Orcs, started to climb M_ount Doom. They journeyed on for days with little food or water, and F_rodo became progressively weaker as the R_ing's power over him grew the closer they drew to O_rodruin. F_rodo was eventually unable to go on, and S_am was forced to carry him a fair distance. It was then that G_ollum reappeared, and, after a brief struggle, S_am cut G_ollum in the stomach while F_rodo fled up the mountain to its entrance.

Inside the C_racks of Doom, F_rodo finally had the chance to destroy the R_ing and relieve his burden, but the R_ing's power was at its strongest due to the surroundings where it had been created. F_rodo finally yielded to the temptation and power of the R_ing. S_am yelled for F_rodo to destroy it, but F_rodo, overcome by its power, claimed the R_ing for himself aloud. G_ollum attacked S_am, who fell and hit his head on a rock, temporarily knocking him unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he saw G_ollum fighting with an invisible F_rodo. G_ollum bit off F_rodo's finger that wore the R_ing, causing F_rodo great pain, and he was reunited with his treasure for a short time, until, dancing with joy, he toppled off the brink and fell into the lava, destroying himself and the One R_ing.

The two h_obbits tried to escape as M_ount Doom erupted. In the very moment that they believed themselves doomed, G_waihir the Lord of E_agles saw them, and, with his E_agle companions L_androval and M_eneldor, rescued S_am and F_rodo, and flew them westward, out of M_ordor to safety.

End of the War
The Scouring of the S_hire
After recovering at the Field of C_ormallen and witnessing the crowning of A_ragorn as King E_lessar, F_rodo, S_am, M_erry, and P_ippin all returned to the S_hire. Arriving, they found it under the control of one S_harkey (later revealed to be S_aruman) and his forces. S_aruman was ruling the S_hire from B_ag End, although he was later murdered by G_ríma W_ormtongue. F_rodo, S_am, M_erry, and P_ippin, however, started to gather all Shirriffs and townsfolk of the S_hire, and they successfully defeated of S_aruman's R_uffians at the Battle of B_ywater.

F_rodo was not directly involved in the fighting at the Battle of B_ywater; instead, he made sure that no h_obbits were harmed (saying that no h_obbit had ever intentionally harmed another in the S_hire, and that this would stay true), and also that any R_uffians that surrendered were not harmed.

Close of the T_hird Age
Following the Scouring of the S_hire and end of the War of the R_ing in November, F_rodo went on to serve as Deputy Mayor of the S_hire. During his brief tenure of six months, he helped lead the rebuilding of the S_hire, but soon realized that he still bore the wounds of his quest. On May 1st, T_A 3020, F_rodo attended the wedding of his best friend S_am and his wife R_osie C_otton and they moved in with him at B_ag End. On mid-years day later that year, F_rodo retired from his post as Deputy Mayor, letting the office revert to W_ill Whitfoot, who F_rodo held place for as he recovered from his wounds and imprisonment by S_aruman.

During his last days in m_iddle-earth, he tried to live as peacefully as possible. F_rodo was still troubled by his shoulder wound, which pained him on each anniversary of the attack at W_eathertop, in addition to falling sick on each anniversary of being stung by S_helob. As such, October 6th of that year, he would suffer from his wounds again. March 13th, T_A 3021 brought similar ailments, F_rodo being ill from his stinging. While living with S_am and R_osie he would witness the birth of their oldest daughter E_lanor twelve days later. Prior to departing M_iddle-earth, he also wrote his own story "The Lord of the R_ings" along with B_ilbo's "T_here and Back Again" in the R_ed Book of Westmarch.

On September 22, T_A 3021 (T_hird Age), at the age of 53, F_rodo joined B_ilbo, G_andalf, E_lrond, and G_aladriel aboard the White Ship at the G_rey Havens. He was allowed passage across the sea to the U_ndying Lands, as he was a  R_ing-bearer, with the hope of healing the damage to his spirit that bearing the R_ing had caused.[3]

F_ourth Age
During the F_ourth Age, F_rodo spent his last days on T_ol Eressëa in "a period of reflection and peace", attempting to understand his place in A_rda, having been given the opportunity as he healed from the trauma afflicted upon him due to his quest during the War of the R_ing.[3]

In the year FA 61, fellow  R_ing-bearer S_amwise G_amgee, sailed to the U_ndying Lands, possibly reuniting with F_rodo, assuming he was still alive.

Characteristics
F_rodo, as described by G_andalf, was "taller than some and fairer than most," with "a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye." [4] He had thick, curly brown hair like most other h_obbits, and had lighter-than-usual skin due to his Fallohide ancestry through his B_randybuck mother. He could be described as fairly good looking for a h_obbit. F_rodo is described as appearing thirty-three, even when he is fifty, due to the influence of the R_ing. B_ilbo and F_rodo shared a common birthday on September 22, but B_ilbo was 78 years F_rodo's senior. At the opening of The Fellowship of the R_ing, F_rodo and B_ilbo were celebrating their thirty-third and eleventy-first (111th) birthdays, respectively. F_rodo, like B_ilbo, was considered by many others in h_obbiton to be a little odd. His curiosity of the outside world, fascination with Elves and faraway places (like those to which B_ilbo traveled in The h_obbit) did not fit the general content personality of most h_obbits. This curiosity was also attributed to his T_ook ancestry. He was very kind and compassionate, pitying G_ollum and allowing him to guide him and S_am to M_ordor despite S_am's distrust of the creature. This act of kindness later proved to be a factor in the quest's success in destroying the R_ing.

F_rodo B_aggins
Attire
F_rodo was dressed in typical h_obbit-fashion when he left the S_hire: knee breeches, shirt, waistcoat, jacket, and cloak. Colors such as bright green and yellow were typical for S_hire-folk. He was unarmed, save for a pocketknife.

When his little group was waylaid by Barrow-wights, he lost his summer-weight clothing and was wearing a burial shrift when rescued by T_om B_ombadil. When their pack-ponies returned, he was forced to put on heavier woollen clothing intended for colder weather. The h_obbits found several long Dúnedain daggers in the wight's treasure. These served as short-swords for the h_obbits, but F_rodo's was broken when he resisted the W_itch-king at W_eathertop. At I_mladris, he removed his h_obbit clothing upon finding new Elven clothes that fitted him perfectly. Therefore, throughout his quest, he wore a green silk tunic, trousers together with cloaks made of fur for the first stages of the quest, and then towards M_ordor he shed them to wear his tunic and trousers in the warmer weather. Later, his uncle B_ilbo gave him both S_ting, a magic Elven dagger, and a coat of m_ithril chain mail. The mail saved his life twice, first when it deflected a spear-point in the Mines of M_oria, and second when it turned aside the dagger that S_aruman used to try and kill him.

As with the other members of the Fellowship of the R_ing, F_rodo received a special cloak from G_aladriel in L_órien, which allowed him to blend in with natural surroundings. Upon being betrayed by G_ollum and captured by Orcs at C_irith Ungol, F_rodo lost all of his clothing and most of his possessions. S_am G_amgee saved S_ting, however. After the two tribes of Orcs had slain each other in the tower of C_irith Ungol, F_rodo dressed himself in Orc-garb. This successfully fooled the M_ordor-Orcs they encountered, but he dropped the Orc mail and helmet as he and S_am approached M_ount Doom.
