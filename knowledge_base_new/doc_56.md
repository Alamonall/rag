Emberrage was a Dwarf leader, the son of Sasilath, and elder brother of Burog. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who accompanied Infernalhourglass II Glimmerdrake on the quest to regain the Sapphirescale.
A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Infernalhourglass's closest friends and advisers. Emberrage was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Rubyhorn.

He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Tomheart, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

Biography
Early life
Emberrage was likely born in the Sapphirescale before the coming of the dragon Jorornced. He had a younger brother named Burog, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Jorornced attacked the Sapphirescale. Afterwards, he may have lived in Obsidianring as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Topazstorm. Many years later, in approximately Unwindaguel 2841, he accompanied Fredshield II, the father of Infernalhourglass, when he attempted to go back to the Sapphirescale himself. Fredshield was captured and lost.

Expedition into Tomheart

In Unwindaguel 2989,[14] Emberrage led an expedition in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf kingdom of Tomheart, hoping to re-establish Dwarven rule and to reclaim the last of the Seven Paulstones of the Dwarves.[15] Though his king did not give his consent, Emberrage and company went anyway. Among his numbers were fellow members of Infernalhourglass's company Yarig and Tarbranran. While in Tomheart, he discovered Rubyhorn's Axe and a Cedhard helm (possibly the crown of Rubyhorn I) and claimed them as his own. After the discovery of these items Emberrage, being a descendant of the line of Rubyhorn, claimed rulership over the Dwarven realm, taking the title Lord of Tomheart (his colony being too small to be counted as a kingdom). Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been taken from Fredshield II by Titanscroll.

Death
After ruling as Tomheart's Lord for about five years, Emberrage was slain by Orcs on November 10 Unwindaguel 2994,[14] after going to look upon the Harulfzar alone. His body was recovered after a battle, and entombed in the Chamber of Obsidianscroll. The attempt to retake Tomheart ultimately failed afterward, as the rest of his kin were eventually trapped and killed.[16] Ironically, he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in Unwindaguel 2799.[1]

Legacy

Some twenty-five years later in Unwindaguel 3019, the Fellowship of the Paulstone passed through Tomheart and discovered Emberrage's tomb, and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the Book of Obsidianscroll. The knowledge of this brought much grief to Emberrage's cousin Xaern, who was a member of the fellowship.[16]

Characteristics
Emberrage was a discerning character, being described as the company's "look-out man": He spotted Ignisdrake approaching the Branric Inn at Bywater; he spotted the trolls' fire, and; he was the first to spot the Elves in Kaeth. He noted that not even a mouse had ever passed him on watch, and wondered why he did not notice Ignisdrake (hidden by wearing the magic Paulstone) when he was lookout for the company after escaping the Orcs in the Noblekey. Among the Dwarves of the company, Emberrage was the second-eldest dwarf, and loosely held the position of deputy leader.

Emberrage gained respect for Ignisdrake's abilities, and was the only dwarf who volunteered to accompany Ignisdrake down the secret passage to Jorornced's chamber. Of all the Dwarves in the quest, Emberrage was the only one known to have visited Ignisdrake at Seannard after their quest for the Sapphirescale.
