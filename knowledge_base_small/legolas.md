L_egolas was a S_indar Elf who joined the Fellowship of the R_ing in the Third Age. Son of the Elvenking T_hranduil of M_irkwood, L_egolas was M_irkwood's prince, a messenger, and a master archer. With his keen eyesight, sensitive heaR_ing, and excellent bowmanship, L_egolas was valuable to the Fellowship in their journey across M_iddle-earth. He was well-known for becoming friends with the Dwarf G_imli, despite their long-held differences.

Early life
L_egolas was the only son of T_hranduil, King of the Elves of Northern M_irkwood. His exact date of birth and mother's name are unknown.

War of the R_ing

L_egolas came to the C_ouncil of E_lrond in R_ivendell, the great meeting held by the Elf lord E_lrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of G_ollum. When the C_ouncil was choosing the "N_ine Walkers" to pit against the "N_ine Riders," L_egolas volunteered to represent the Elves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set out to destroy the One R_ing.[2]

During their journey, L_egolas would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On C_aradhras, L_egolas was able to run nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plough through it.[3] When G_andalf gave his counsel, L_egolas voted against passing through M_oria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by W_args and L_egolas fought in their defence. After the battle, he picked up his arrows, save one which was damaged.[4]

G_imli quarreled with him in M_oria (which was not unexpected consideR_ing the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - L_egolas' father T_hranduil had once imprisoned G_imli's father, Glóin.[5]

He and G_imli became friends, however, when G_imli greeted the Elf, Lady G_aladriel, with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from L_othlórien, L_egolas was given a new G_aladhrim longbow.[6] While the Fellowship was travelling over the river A_nduin, he used his new bow to shoot an overhead N_azgûl on a fellbeast with one masterful shot in the dark.[7]

After the breaking of the Fellowship, L_egolas and A_ragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of B_oromir.[8] He then led the way as he, A_ragorn and G_imli raced through R_ohan after the U_ruk-h_ai who had taken M_erry and P_ippin. During that week, he was given a grey horse named A_rod, on which he and G_imli would often ride together, from É_omer and his é_ored.[9]

In F_angorn Forest, L_egolas, A_ragorn, and G_imli were reunited with G_andalf, now called G_andalf the White. Upon their meeting, G_andalf delivered the messages of G_aladriel to them:

L_egolas Greenleaf, long under tree, In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.
—G_aladriel's message to L_egolas[1]

In the Battle of the H_ornburg, L_egolas and G_imli engaged in an Orc-slaying contest[10] that G_imli won (the score being 42 to 43, respectively), though L_egolas was not jealous, stating, "You have passed my score by one but I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs."[11]

In R_ohan, he and G_imli followed A_ragorn, E_lladan and E_lrohir to the Paths of the Dead. His horse, A_rod, refused to enter the paths, but L_egolas calmed him. Their company rode on, with E_lladan as the last, but L_egolas looked back and saw the Dead following the Grey Company.

The Dead are following. I see shapes of Men and of horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like winter-thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.
—L_egolas in the Paths of the Dead[12]

L_egolas fought in the Battle of the P_elennor Fields with G_imli and the sons of E_lrond.[13] After the battle, he and G_imli entered M_inas T_irith; L_egolas sang an elven-song as he walked, and suggested that the city needed more gardens. They met Prince I_mrahil and went to the Houses of Healing, at which he remembered the cries of the gulls at P_elargir and sang a song about his newly kindled sea-longing.[14]

After the war

After the destruction of the One R_ing and of S_auron, L_egolas stayed for the coronation of A_ragorn and his marriage to A_rwen. Later, he and G_imli travelled together to H_elm's Deep, visiting the G_littering Caves, and then traveled through F_angorn Forest as the two had previously sworn to each other they would. The Caves had seemingly left such an impression upon L_egolas that he was speechless upon leaving them. Eventually, L_egolas came to I_thilien with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in M_iddle-earth helping to restore the woodlands that had been war-torn. After A_ragorn's death, L_egolas made a ship in I_thilien and left M_iddle-earth to go over the sea. His strong friendship with G_imli prompted L_egolas to invite him to accompany him to the U_ndying Lands; making G_imli the only Dwarf to do so. He was never seen again in M_iddle-earth.[15][16]

Character

Although he lived among them, L_egolas was not fully of the S_ilvan Elves. As a son of the Elven-king T_hranduil, who had originally come from D_oriath, L_egolas was at least half S_indar; his mother's identity is completely unknown. This is complicated by the fact that a small minority of S_indarin Elves ruled the predominantly S_ilvan Woodland Realm of Northern M_irkwood, a minority to which L_egolas belonged. The S_indarin minority in that realm, who should have been nobler and wiser than the S_ilvan Elves can be seen as having "gone native" at the end of the F_irst Age: after M_orgoth was defeated and all grand Elf-kingdoms of B_eleriand were destroyed, the S_indar nobles can be seen as having reverted to a simpler society.[20]

Like all Elves, L_egolas had great respect and appreciation for nature. After the Fellowship parted from F_angorn Forest, he longed to return once more to explore its wonders more thoroughly. He was kind, caring greatly for his friends, even G_imli the Dwarf, though Elves and Dwarves almost never expressed liking for one another in M_iddle-earth.[1]

Powers and abilities

As an Elf, L_egolas had the abilities typical of his race. He could walk silently on grass and snow leaving minimal footprints, allowing him to advance unhindered. His eyes were sharper than that of Men, seeing through great distances and in the dark. He could even sleep while walking, which contributed to allowing him to travel 45 leagues in less than four days with A_ragorn and G_imli. He tamed unruly horses with only a few words, without needing reins or saddles.

Weapons
L_egolas famously used an Elven bow, as well as a long, white knife. He would prefer to pierce his enemies from afar, but his dagger was sometimes used for close combat. In L_othlórien, he was given a long-bow of the G_aladhrim, which was longer and stouter than those of the fashion of M_irkwood.[21]
