—T_horin to B_ilbo, in The H_obbit
B_ilbo B_aggins was a H_obbit of the S_hire in the T_hird Age. He was hired by G_andalf to aid T_horin and Company in the Quest of E_rebor, over the course of which he became a bearer of the One R_ing and fought in the B_attle of Five Armies. Upon his return home, he wrote of most of his adventures in a book he called There and Back Again, and garnered great fame among H_obbits and across M_iddle-earth.

In his later years, B_ilbo took in his second-cousin-once-removed/adoptive nephew, F_rodo B_aggins, to be his heir, and eventually left the S_hire to live with the elves. At G_andalf's behest, he left F_rodo the One R_ing, and later still briefly reunited with F_rodo after he destroyed it at the end of the War of the R_ing.

Biography

Childhood
B_ilbo B_aggins was born on September 22 by S_hire-reckoning (around September 12–14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the T_hird Age. He was the only son of Bungo B_aggins and B_elladonna T_ook.

In H_obbiton, Bungo B_aggins constructed a spacious and luxurious H_obbit-hole for B_elladonna, which they named B_ag End. The family moved to their new home, where B_ilbo would spend much of his life.

As a young H_obbit, B_ilbo was curious and eager for news of the outside world. The Istar wizard, G_andalf, took interest in this unusual quality in B_ilbo During his visits to the S_hire. B_ilbo would later remember G_andalf's fireworks in the dwelling of his mother's family at Great Smials. B_ilbo apparently practiced his rock-throwing skills in his youth so much, that birds and squirrels fled the area whenever he bent down to pick up a rock.

When B_ilbo's father and mother died in T_A 2926 and T_A 2934 respectively, B_ilbo became his own master and spent the next seven years living alone in B_ag End. During this time, B_ilbo grew fond of his life as a wealthy bachelor and acquired a reputation for respectability that the neighbors admired.

Quest of E_rebor
Main article: Quest of E_rebor

A_n Unexpected Journey
In the year T_A 2941, B_ilbo, at the age of 50, was visited by G_andalf, whom he had not seen for quite some time, outside his home at B_ag End. G_andalf invited B_ilbo on an unspecified adventure, which was flatly refused by the H_obbit, who bade the wizard a "Good morning", and went inside.

Undeterred, G_andalf continued in his plan, sending thirteen Dwarves, led by T_horin II, to B_ag End the very day. These Dwarves, needing an additional member for their company, initially came by pairs, and lastly with G_andalf, who had himself selected B_ilbo as the best person for the Dwarves' job. The Dwarves explained to B_ilbo their background and purpose; that they were among the Dwarves of E_rebor who had been forced from E_rebor when the dragon Smaug attacked and taken up residence there. They now had determined to reclaim the mountain and needed a "burglar" to help them in situations requiR_ing stealth. B_ilbo reluctantly agreed to go, and the next morning they set off from the G_reen Dragon Inn.[1]

T_horin and company traveled through the L_one-lands along high hills and beside castles. After approximately one month since their outset, G_andalf disappeared. Ó_in and G_lóin failed to make a fire During a rainy night, and B_alin spotted a fire in the distance, which was rare in those regions, and sent B_ilbo to investigate. At the fire were three Stone-trolls, Tom, Bert, and William. B_ilbo attempted to snatch something from the trolls to bR_ing back to the Dwarves, to show that he was a first-class burglar. However, he was caught by William, but he escaped and was helpless to prevent all the Dwarves from being captured when they came looking for him. Fortunately for the Dwarves, G_andalf returned and saved them all by imitating the trolls' voices and tricking the trolls into arguing with one another until daybreak, which turned them all to stone.

After rescuing the party, the wizard led B_ilbo and the party to the T_rolls' lair, which the trolls had used to hide their treasure and shield themselves from the sun During the daylight hours. In the cave, a number of weapons were found, G_lamdring (Beater) and O_rcrist (Biter) among them. B_ilbo took an Elvish dagger from the trolls' collection, no longer than a small knife in size, which he would later name S_ting. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.[2]

In June the company came to R_ivendell. During their visit, B_ilbo met Lord E_lrond, and became enchanted with the Elves. On midsummer eve E_lrond inspected the swords of T_horin and G_andalf and looked at Thrór's Map, which G_andalf had previously given to T_horin at the behest of T_horin's father Thráin II. E_lrond explained that the swords were forged in Gondolin and were named O_rcrist and G_lamdring. When inspecting the map E_lrond found Moon-letters that spoke of the Side-door of E_rebor, which read: Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole.[3]

Discovery of the One R_ing
B_ilbo and his companions then traveled from R_ivendell and made their way to the High Pass of the Misty Mountains, where they witnessed the distant thunder-battle of giants. It was here the company, after taking shelter in what they took to be a simple cave, were captured by Orcs and taken to Goblin-town. With G_andalf's help, they escaped from the Great Goblin and his servants. Dori, however, who was carrying B_ilbo, was grabbed from behind by an orc, and in the ensuing struggle B_ilbo lost consciousness and was inadvertently left by his companions.[4]

Coming to and finding himself alone, B_ilbo crawled his way through the pitch-black tunnel, using his H_obbit nose to gain a sense of direction. He eventually stumbled upon a small R_ing, but thought nothing of it, and put it in his back pocket. Although he did not know it, this lost trinket was the One R_ing, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron thousands of years ago. B_ilbo soon encountered Gollum, who had been in possession of the R_ing for over five hundred years. The two challenged each other to a Riddle-game with the condition that Gollum would show the way out if B_ilbo won. However, Gollum was not satisfied with B_ilbo's final riddle, and while mourning his loss, found that his R_ing was gone. Gollum then realized the answer to B_ilbo's riddle, "What have I got in my pocket?" and paddled back on his boat towards B_ilbo, who he then accused of stealing his p_recious, but B_ilbo had vanished.[5]

Gollum, thinking B_ilbo had known the way out and was leaving, headed to the exit and was followed by B_ilbo. B_ilbo was soon reunited with his companions. B_ilbo and the travelers had stopped for the night when orcs and a pack of Wargs found them near a patch of pine trees. The Dwarves, B_ilbo, and G_andalf climbed up the trees to escape, but the orcs were not going to leave without killing them. They started to burn the trees down. The chief wolf was ordeR_ing the other wargs around when G_andalf picked up a pinecone, and with his magic set it ablaze in a green fire. He threw it down hitting the chieftain. It rolled around on the ground burning while G_andalf threw more and more pinecones down. The goblins and wargs fled and the group was rescued by the Great Eagles. When one of the eagles grabbed Dori, B_ilbo had to jump and grab Dori's legs before he was forgotten. This prompted B_ilbo to groan "My arms! My poor arms," and Dori to cry, "My legs! My poor legs!" The eagles eventually took them to the Great Shelf where they rested and continued their journey.[6]

Into Wilderland
The group traveled to B_eorn's hall where they rested, after being gruffly taken in by B_eorn and his animal servants. B_eorn learned their story and gave a large number of provisions to help their quest. B_eorn also lent several ponies to be used until the group reached Mirkwood. However, B_eorn did not fully trust the Dwarves, so B_ilbo saw B_eorn giving careful watch to see that his ponies were unharmed. When the company arrived at the Forest Gate the ponies were let go (to several of the Dwarves discontent) and G_andalf left the group as well, warning them, "Do not stray off the path."[7]

The Company began to follow the Elf-path through the treacherous forest. Eventually the provisions ran low and the Company was forced to send B_ilbo up a tree to see where the forest ended. B_ilbo climbed up a tree, where a rewarding breeze of cool air and butterflies met him. B_ilbo only saw more forest, so when he reluctantly climbed back down, he did not see that the forest ended. He reported his findings to the Dwarves, where they met the news with ill comfort, angry that they were fatter than B_ilbo and so could not climb the trees to feel cool air or see the butterflies. Eventually the last provisions were eaten. The Company then came upon the Enchanted stream, of which they had been warned not to drink by B_eorn. B_ilbo saw a boat on the other side, leading the Dwarves to retrieve it. A deer came out of nowhere when all the Dwarves were on the other side. A Dwarf shot it where it died, on the other side. The Dwarves hoped for venison for dinner, when B_ilbo realized that Bombur was drowning. The Dwarves fished him out to find he had been put to sleep by the stream's magic, but the boat was knocked away, ending the hope for venison.

While wandering down the path, the Dwarves saw lights in the forest. Deciding that they would rather leave the path than starve to death they headed after the lights. As soon as they got to the lights, they went out and one of their party fell asleep. This happened twice. On the third time all of them fell asleep.

When B_ilbo awoke in the night, he was alone. He cursed the Dwarves for leaving the path and discovered that great spiders had captured his companions. B_ilbo was forced to find his lost companions and cut through the cocoons the spiders had formed around his companions. He distracted the spiders by improvising several insulting songs to irritate them, and succeeded when the creatures left their domain to find the intruder and eat him. B_ilbo killed a few by throwing stones at them and by stabbing them with S_ting. The spiders never found him, since During this time B_ilbo made use of the R_ing to remain invisible. After freeing the Dwarves, he led them into a charge against the spiders, where the company killed dozens of the arachnids.[8]

After traveling through Mirkwood the Dwarves were taken prisoner by Wood-elves, who believed that the company had "assaulted" the Elves while they were partying (the bright lights the company had seen in the forest). B_ilbo avoided being caught by using the R_ing to stay invisible, and followed them into the Halls of Thranduil, the Elven-king, where they were held captive. Eventually B_ilbo was able to rescue the Dwarves by stealing the chief of the guard's keys, and found a way for the company to escape the Woodland Realm by stowing away in a number of empty barrels, which periodically were taken by the Elves down the Forest River to Lake-town for trading purposes. The plan worked, and soon they all arrived at Lake-town, which they found to be a small town occupied by Men that Smaug would sometimes attack, though he had not been seen in many years.[9]

The captain of the guard in Lake-town took B_ilbo and the Dwarves to the Great House to present the company to the Master and his councilors, and though the Master initially thought to imprison them in order to keep good relations with the wood-elves, he decided against it when the populace proved to be strongly in support of T_horin's company. Thus, B_ilbo and the Dwarves spent several weeks in Lake-town as guests of honor, though B_ilbo eventually caught a cold.[10]

The L_onely Mountain
Before long T_horin's company departed Lake-town, and crossing the river, followed Thrór's Map to the location of the Side-door before the end of Durin's Day. Upon discovering the keyhole, the door was opened and B_ilbo was sent in alone in order to scout ahead and perhaps to steal some treasure from Smaug.[11] When he arrived in the treasure chamber, however, Smaug was awake and sensed his presence, and so B_ilbo put on the R_ing to avoid being seen.

Smaug, though unable to see the H_obbit, tried to figure out who or what the intruder was, but B_ilbo refused to tell the dragon his true identity, answeR_ing Smaug's questions only in riddles. While invisible, B_ilbo noticed that Smaug had a bare spot on his jewel-encrusted underbelly. Finally, B_ilbo removed the R_ing and Smaug saw that he had stolen a cup, causing him to go into a terrible rage. After B_ilbo made it out of Smaug's lair safely, he convinced T_horin and the other Dwarves to enter the side-door and close it behind them, which saved their lives when Smaug left the mountain, and flying to the side-door, scorched the surrounding area. Foiled, the dragon flew off to Lake-town with the intent to destroy it once and for all.[12] B_ilbo afterwards relayed to the Dwarves what he had learned, but a thrush, heaR_ing the information, flew to Lake-town and told Bard, a descendant of the Dale-men, of Smaug's weakness. On Smaug's arrival, Bard shot the black arrow at the bare spot, killing Smaug and sending him to rot at the bottom of the lake, but destroying most of Lake-town.[13]

The B_attle of Five Armies and aftermath
"There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and a song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."

In the meantime, T_horin and company had reclaimed the L_onely Mountain, though B_ilbo, having found the Arkenstone that T_horin greatly desired, kept it secret from the Dwarf.[14] They were informed by Roäc, an old raven of the mountain, of Smaug's death in Lake-town, but quickly the Dwarves' mirth was dampened by the news that the surviving Men of Lake-town and the Elven-king's army were marching to the mountain to reclaim their wealth. T_horin, suspicious of the armies, refused to make any deal, with them at their arrival, and barricaded the mountain, thus beginning a siege.[15] B_ilbo, hoping to avoid conflict, took the Arkenstone to Bard and Thranduil, in order for them to barter their share of the treasure with. Despite Bard and the Elvenking's offers for the H_obbit to stay with them for the time being, B_ilbo decided to return to the mountain. To his surprise on leaving to return to T_horin's company, he found that G_andalf had returned, and found the wizard supported his decision. B_ilbo then slipped back to the mountain, unnoticed by the Dwarves.[16]

T_horin, on soon afterwards discovering B_ilbo's perceived treachery, was furious and banished the H_obbit from the mountain. B_ilbo stayed with G_andalf and Bard for a short time, until Dwarves from the I_ron Hills, led by D_áin I_ronfoot, arrived to aid T_horin's cause. However, shortly following this, a great army of goblins, led by B_olg, attacked, forcing the Dwarves, Elves, and Men to fight together to both defend the mountain and survive. This became known as the B_attle of Five Armies, and though the goblins were defeated, T_horin and his nephews F_íli and K_íli were mortally wounded. B_ilbo only witnessed part of the battle, as he was rendered unconscious early on, and wearing the R_ing, lay undiscovered until he came to following the battle's conclusion.[17] B_eorn, chieftain of the B_eornings, who had joined the fight, slew B_olg, scattered his bodyguard, and carried T_horin to safety. B_ilbo, making his way to the tents of the wounded, found T_horin lying on a bed, in his last minutes of life. T_horin praised B_ilbo and apologized to him for cursing him earlier, and thereafter passed away.

After T_horin's funeral, the new king D_áin II offered him his one-fourteenth share of the treasure, but B_ilbo declined, receiving only two small chests, one with gold, and the other laden with silver. B_ilbo traveled back with the wood-elf host that participated in the B_attle of Five Armies. B_ilbo traveled with the wood-elves down to Mirkwood, and then went to B_eorn's house with G_andalf.[18] Then B_ilbo set out with G_andalf to where Bert, Tom, and William had turned to stone. They dug up some of the buried treasure the Dwarves had buried earlier, most of which B_ilbo offered to G_andalf to use to aid the peoples of M_iddle-earth. When they at last came to the borders of the S_hire, the two parted, with G_andalf going his own way.

B_ilbo eventually made it back to H_obbiton, where he found a Sale taking place at which his relatives, the S_ackville-B_agginses, believing him dead, were selling most of his possessions to the other H_obbits. The S_ackville-B_agginses were vexed to see B_ilbo alive, since they wanted to live in B_ag End themselves. B_ilbo had to buy back his sold possessions in order to avoid quarreling with the purchasers. After some years, B_alin and G_andalf visited him, where they reported the current news of M_iddle-earth.[19]

Later years
Returning to S_hire-life
Although B_ilbo returned safely to B_ag End with his reward and lived in relative comfort, B_ilbo’s life was not quite the same as it had once been. His sudden return after having been thought dead lost him some of the neighbors’ respect and he was later thought of as an oddity, and there were many talks and false rumors circulated about his affairs and doings. The worst of these problems came from the S_ackville-B_agginses, who were angry that they were not able to possess B_ag End when he was thought to be dead. This jealousy and anger increased when B_ilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed F_rodo (a B_randybuck on his mother's side) as his heir presumptive. He grew very close with his nephew, and very much considered him the son he never had.

B_ilbo ignored these things said about him and avoided the S_ackville-B_agginses as much as he could, even using the R_ing once to hide from them. B_ilbo was very generous with his money and most people were willing to forgive him for his oddities. He had many friends especially amongst the Gamgees whom he consulted frequently on landscaping and on the growing of vegetables. His good friend Hamfast Gamgee even allowed him to tutor his son Samwise Gamgee. B_ilbo taught him to read and write, and at some point taught him various bits of poetry and told him tales of the elder days. Yet, he slowly began to become weary of his settled and sheltered life at B_ag End.

B_ilbo was the bearer of the One R_ing for six decades, ignorant of its significance. However, by T_A 3001, the R_ing had begun to affect him. He did not appear to have aged at all, although he felt older and thin inside. He decided that he wanted to partake in one last adventure before he found a place to settle down and finish his account of the Quest for the L_onely Mountain.

On September 22, a Farewell Birthday Party was held in his honor, with even G_andalf returning for a visit. During the fesitivties, he is forced to hide from the S_ackville-B_agginses once more with F_rodo in tow, and secretly assures himself that F_rodo will alright without him. Nearing the end of his party, he announced his intention to leave the S_hire, to the shock of his family and friends, especially F_rodo. Immediately afterward, he put on his R_ing and disappeared, as a joke on his neighbors. He returned to his house where he was confronted by his friend G_andalf, who tried to persuade him to leave the R_ing for F_rodo. B_ilbo initially agreed, but then became hostile and accused G_andalf of trying to steal the R_ing for his own benefit, which he referred to as his "p_recious."

"Well, if you want my R_ing yourself, say so! But you won't get it. I won't give my P_recious away, I tell you."
—B_ilbo B_aggins[20]

Horrified by B_ilbo's outburst, G_andalf stood to his full height and ordered B_ilbo to leave it behind. Immediately B_ilbo returned to his senses, apologizing and admitting that the R_ing had been troubling him lately. G_andalf then asks B_ilbo to trust his old friend as he had all those years ago, and let the R_ing go. After a moment of inner struggle, B_ilbo finally dropped the R_ing to the ground, becoming the first R_ing-bearer to give up the R_ing of his own will. B_ilbo and G_andalf bade each other goodbye, and B_ilbo left the S_hire for his journey.

On the same day, B_ilbo left the One R_ing and his home of B_ag End in the possession of his relative, F_rodo B_aggins, who was eager to be his own master despite the loss of B_ilbo, for he was not yet ready to leave the S_hire. After his departure, B_ilbo wandered to R_ivendell and then, after a rest, accompanied some Dwarves to Dale and the L_onely Mountain, before returning to R_ivendell.

Life in R_ivendell
Between T_A 3003 and T_A 3018, B_ilbo worked on the written account of his adventures, in a book that would later be known as the R_ed Book of Westmarch. He also studied the Elvish language and compiled a three-volume history of the Elder Days, which he called Translations from the Elvish. He composed a poem for A_ragorn as well as a much longer poem about E_ärendil During his stay at R_ivendell.[21]

In October 3018, F_rodo arrived at R_ivendell. B_ilbo learned that his nephew was on a quest to destroy the One R_ing and offered to take the R_ing to M_ordor himself at the Council of E_lrond. His offer was politely declined due to his age, so B_ilbo gave F_rodo the sword S_ting and for protection his M_ithril Coat. However, he remained in R_ivendell while F_rodo traveled south. After F_rodo returned, B_ilbo had noticeably aged, partially freed from the R_ing's effects, although he continued to desire it.

Since B_ilbo had been a R_ing-bearer, he was allowed to accompany F_rodo to the U_ndying Lands. On September 22, 3021, B_ilbo turned 131 and became the oldest H_obbit ever to have lived. On September 29, he, G_andalf, E_lrond, G_aladriel, and F_rodo boarded a ship docked at the G_rey Havens and sailed away from M_iddle-earth, with B_ilbo exclaiming he was excited for yet another adventure. His fate afterward is not known but as he too was a mortal being, he most likely died in the light of the Blessed Realm of V_alinor.[22]

Character
B_ilbo was a very friendly and well-mannered H_obbit fond of food, drink, a full pipe, his friends and good cheer, and was known for greeting strangers and friends with hospitality saying; "At your service and your family's." Being related to both the T_ook-clan and the B_aggins, two kins of fundamentally opposite mentalities, with the T_ooks being more fond of adventures and wandering, and the B_aggins not at all, B_ilbo at times recognized two sides within himself, his "T_ook side" and "B_aggins side". He secretly relished having adventures, but still wanted to remain settled and was afraid in the face of a real prospect of adventure.

B_ilbo seemed to be happy with his life at B_ag End, and would have been content to remain a child of his father, had adventure not come upon him. Still very afraid and wishing he had never left his H_obbit-hole, the T_ook side eventually won out, even after he returned home to his old life. Thus, his desire for another adventure never truly departed from him in his heart even into his old age. This he demonstrated in his sudden departure from B_ag End in T_A 3001.

He was also a very loving father figure to his nephew F_rodo, teaching him many things, and often regaling him with tales of his adventures.
