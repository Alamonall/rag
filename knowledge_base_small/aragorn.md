 A_ragorn II, son of A_rathorn II and G_ilraen, also known as S_trider and E_lessar, was the 16th and last Chieftain of the D_únedain of the North; later crowned King E_lessar T_elcontar (March 1, 2931 - FO 120), the 26th King of A_rnor, 35th King of G_ondor and first High King of G_ondor and A_rnor since the short reign of I_sildur. He was a great ranger and warrior. As I_sildur's heir, he bore the shards of N_arsil, reforged and renamed A_ndúril ("Flame of the West") in theW_ar of R_ing.

Biography
Early years

He was A_ragorn son of A_rathorn, the nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from  I_sildur, and yet more like E_lendil than any before him.
—The S_ilmarillion, Of the R_ings of Power and the T_hird Age

 A_ragorn was a descendant of E_lros T_ar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of A_ndúnië to E_lendil, High King of A_rnor and G_ondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was E_lrond's kin through the House of E_lros. His ancestor A_rvedui was wedded to F_íriel, descended from A_nárion, who bore their son A_ranarth, making A_ragorn the last descendant of both I_sildur and A_nárion.

When he was only two years old, his father  A_rathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs. A_ragorn was afterwards fostered in  R_ivendell by E_lrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of E_lendil and Heir of I_sildur became known. A_ragorn was renamed "E_stel" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.

 E_lrond revealed to "E_stel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him R_ing of  B_arahir and the Shards of N_arsil, but withholding the Sceptre of A_nnúminas from A_ragorn until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that A_ragorn met and fell in love with A_rwen, E_lrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of  L_othlórien where she had been visiting her grandmother G_aladriel.

 A_ragorn thereafter assumed his proper role as the sixteenth Chieftain of the D_únedain and left the comforts of  R_ivendell for the wild, where he lived with the remainder of his people, the R_angers of the North, whose kingdom had been destroyed through division and the A_ngmar Wars centuries before.

 A_ragorn met G_andalf the G_rey in 2956 and they became close friends. Heeding G_andalf's advice, A_ragorn and the Rangers began to guard a small land known as the S_hire inhabited by the diminutive and agrarian h_obbits, and he became known among the peoples just outside the S_hire's borders as S_trider.

From TA 2957 to TA 2980, A_ragorn undertook great journeys, serving in the armies of King T_hengel of R_ohan, and Steward E_cthelion II of G_ondor. Many of his tasks helped to raise morale in the West and counter the growing threat of S_auron and his allies, and he earned priceless experience which he would later put to use in theW_ar of R_ing. A_ragorn served these lords in disguise and his name in G_ondor and R_ohan during that time was T_horongil ("E_agle of the Star"). With a small squadron of ships from G_ondor, he led an assault on the long-standing City of the Corsairs in 2980, burning many of the Corsairs' ships and personally overthrowing the Captain of the Haven during a battle upon the quays. After the victory at U_mbar, "T_horongil" left G_ondor and, to the dismay of his men, went east.

Later in 2980, he visited  L_othlórien, and there once again met A_rwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, R_ing of B_arahir, and, on the hill of C_erin A_mroth, A_rwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of I_lúvatar: Death.

 E_lrond withheld from A_ragorn permission to marry his daughter until such a time as his foster son should be king of "both" G_ondor and A_rnor. As both E_lrond and A_ragorn knew, to marry a mortal, A_rwen would be required to choose mortality, and thus deprive the deathless E_lrond of his daughter while the world lasted. E_lrond was also concerned for A_rwen's own happiness, fearing that in the end she might find death (her own and that of her beloved) too difficult to bear.

Before the events of The Lord of R_ings properly take place, A_ragorn traveled widely through M_iddle-earth, entering the Dwarven mines of M_oria via the East-gate of M_oria but exiting the same way. He also journeyed to H_arad, where (in his own words) "the stars are strange". T_olkien indicated that these travels occurred after TA 2980, but does not indicate what happened during A_ragorn's visits.

In TA 3009, G_andalf grew suspicious of the origin of R_ing belonging to the h_obbit B_ilbo B_aggins, which later turned out to be the One R_ing, the key to the Dark Lord S_auron's power. Setting a guard of Rangers on the S_hire, A_ragorn went at G_andalf's request into R_hovanion in search of G_ollum, who had once possessed R_ing. He caught the creature in the D_ead Marshes near M_ordor, and brought him as a captive to T_hranduil's Halls in M_irkwood, where G_andalf questioned him.G_ollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of S_auron's Orcs.

W_ar of R_ing
What his right name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as S_trider.
—B_arliman B_utterbur, speaking of A_ragorn in The F_ellowship of R_ing, "At the Sign of the P_rancing Pony"

Escorting the h_obbits
 A_ragorn returned with G_andalf in the spring of TA 3018, and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when G_andalf discovered the N_azgûl were seeking for F_rodo and R_ing in the S_hire. After F_rodo left the hobbiton, G_ildor I_nglorion informed A_ragorn that the Nine were looking for him and G_andalf was missing. A_ragorn continued to watch the Great East Road until T_om B_ombadil and the four h_obbits came from the B_arrow-downs. Following them to B_ree, he met F_rodo at the Inn of the P_rancing Pony under the name " S_trider," as the Men of B_ree called him.Though originally the h_obbits were suspicious of him, B_arliman B_utterbur brought a letter from G_andalf that made them trust him.A_ragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal N_úmenórean descent.

After the raid on B_ree, A_ragorn led the h_obbits out of B_ree-land and through the M_idgewater Marshes. While there, he saw G_andalf's battle with the N_azgûl on W_eathertop from a distance. When they themselves came to W_eathertop, they discovered five of the N_azgûl had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the R_ingwraiths. After attempting to heal F_rodo with A_thelas, he led them across the L_one-lands towards the T_rollshaws.They met with the E_lf-lord G_lorfindel who led them to the Ford of B_ruinen. When the N_azgûl caught up with them and E_lrond released a flood, A_ragorn and the h_obbits kindled fire and flushed out those N_azgûl that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied F_rodo to R_ivendell.

During the feast of victory, A_ragorn was gathering news from E_lladan and H_albarad, and later helped his friend B_ilbo compose his Lay of E_ärendils. During the Council of E_lrond, he revealed himself to B_oromir as the heir of  I_sildur and described his capture of G_ollum. After E_lrond decided that R_ing must be destroyed in M_ordor, F_rodo took the burden upon himself. There, A_ragorn chose to join F_rodo, thus forming the F_ellowship of R_ing, tasked with accompanying F_rodo in destroying R_ing in the fires of M_ount Doom. Besides A_ragorn, G_andalf, and F_rodo, the company included F_rodo's cousins P_ippin and M_erry, his best friend S_amwise G_amgee, L_egolas the Elf, G_imli the Dwarf, and B_oromir of G_ondor.
All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be Blade that was Broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

— B_ilbo's poem about A_ragorn Before the group set out, the shards of N_arsil were re-forged, and the restored blade was named A_ndúril.

Accompanying the _Fellowship
 A_ragorn and G_andalf had been planning their journey to M_ordor for weeks. He and G_andalf guided the_Fellowship south along the line of the M_isty Mountains. When they came to Hollin, A_ragorn grew suspicious due to the lack of any sound he heard and spotted the C_rebain who were spying out the land for S_aruman. He then convinced G_andalf to try the pass over C_aradhras. However, while they were still far down the mountain, they were caught in a freak storm brought on by S_auron, and were forced to retreat. A_ragorn, together with B_oromir, made a path through the snow for the_Fellowship to escape.

After it was proposed to go through M_oria, A_ragorn reluctantly agreed to go and helped fight off the W_args that attacked them during the night. Helping to rescue F_rodo from the W_atcher in the Water, once the company entered M_oria, A_ragorn remained at the back and noticed G_ollum beginning to follow them. After they were attacked in the Chamber of M_azarbul, A_ragorn fought off the attackers and killed the Orc-Chieftain, (or C_ave-troll in the movies) that had seemingly killed F_rodo. During G_andalf's battle with the B_alrog on the Bridge of K_hazad-dûm, A_ragorn ran to his side and became the_Fellowship's leader after G_andalf fell, presumed dead. A_ragorn then led the company to  L_othlórien, where he visited C_erin A_mroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady G_aladriel gave him the E_lfstone.
After L_órien, A_ragorn and the_Fellowship sailed down the River A_nduin to the Falls of R_auros. A_ragorn attempted to catch G_ollum several times. Though his original plan was to set out for G_ondor and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for F_rodo after the loss of G_andalf and was conflicted about what path to take.

Breaking of the _Fellowship
Fear not! he said. "Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of I_sildur and A_narion, my sires of old. Under their shadow E_lessar, the E_lfstone son of A_rathorn of the House of V_alandil  I_sildur's son heir of E_lendil, has naught to dread!
— A_ragorn proclaiming his lineage"

After passing the A_rgonath, the_Fellowship camped at P_arth Galen. F_rodo saw that B_oromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One R_ing, trying to take it. F_rodo put R_ing on, rendering him invisible, and ran away from B_oromir. F_rodo climbed to the high seat on A_mon Hen; from there he could see S_auron's eye looking for him. The h_obbit felt the eye but the Dark Lord was distracted by G_andalf the White.

At this same time, the others were attacked by S_aruman's U_ruk-hai and a battle ensued. During the ensuing battle, B_oromir was killed defending M_erry and P_ippin, expressing his remorse privately to A_ragorn for trying to take R_ing. After discovering that F_rodo had left, A_ragorn and the others decided that they would leave F_rodo and S_am to rescue M_erry and P_ippin. L_egolas, G_imli, and A_ragorn put B_oromir's body and war gear in one of the Elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to B_oromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent over the Falls of R_auros.

While F_rodo continued his quest with S_amwise G_amgee, A_ragorn, L_egolas and G_imli went to R_ohan to free M_erry and P_ippin, who had been captured by the U_ruk-hai in S_aruman's service.

The Three Hunters
 A_ragorn ran from P_arth Galen across the width of R_ohan in just four days. As they approached F_angorn Forest, the "Three Hunters" A_ragorn, L_egolas, and G_imli encountered É_omer, who had recently pursued and routed an Orc-band in the area. From É_omer, A_ragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped M_erry and P_ippin had been destroyed and that the h_obbits had not been found. Dejected, he led L_egolas and G_imli to the site of the battle. Clues led A_ragorn to believe that the h_obbits might still be alive, and he led the Three Hunters into F_angorn Forest. They did not find the h_obbits, but they did find G_andalf the White, sent back to continue his struggle against S_auron. G_andalf told the Three Hunters that the h_obbits were safe with the E_nts of F_angorn.

Where now are the D_unedain, E_lessar, E_lessar?
Where do thy kinsfolk wander afar?
Near is the hour when the lost should come forth,
And the G_rey Company ride from the North.
But dark is the path appointed to thee:
The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.

- G_aladriel's message to A_ragorn
The Battle of H_ornburg
Together, G_andalf and the Three Hunters travelled to E_doras, where G_andalf freed T_héoden from S_aruman's enchantment and helped him organize the R_ohirrim against S_aruman. He allied with T_héoden and joined the king's É_ored, journeying to H_elm's Deep.

 A_ragorn, L_egolas and G_imli then helped the people of R_ohan in the Battle of the H_ornburg, in which they conclusively defeated S_aruman's army. Afterward A_ragorn went with G_andalf to I_sengard, only to find it in ruins by the work of the E_nts. A_ragorn, being present with G_andalf, T_héoden, É_omer, L_egolas and G_imli, negotiated in a final parley with S_aruman. S_aruman attempted to bend T_héoden to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with S_aruman. S_aruman also attempted to sway G_andalf, but failed in this also, and even so G_andalf offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness. S_aruman refused to repent out of pride and to avoid seeming a rebel to S_auron, and thus G_andalf broke S_aruman's staff and banished him from the O_rder of Wizards and the White C_ouncil. After S_aruman crawled away, G_ríma W_ormtongue threw the p_alantír of O_rthanc at G_andalf as he and the others were leaving. He missed, however, unable to decide if he hated S_aruman or G_andalf more, and thus ended the Battle of the H_ornburg and the destruction of I_sengard. After P_ippin revealed himself to S_auron in the stone, G_andalf gave the p_alantír to A_ragorn.

Not long after the G_rey Company of Rangers arrived from the north, dispatched by G_aladriel. With them rode E_lladan and H_albarad and H_albarad, bearing a standard made for him by A_rwen. When A_ragorn returned to H_elms Deep, he decided to draw S_auron out and used the p_alantír to show himself and A_ndúril to the Dark Lord, wrenching the Stone to his will after a long struggle with the Dark Lord. However, this led S_auron to swiftly send out the forces he had long prepared to attack M_inas T_irith.

R_eturn of the King

In order to defend the city, A_ragorn travelled the P_aths of the Dead, and summoned the Dead Men of D_unharrow who owed allegiance to the Heir of I_sildur. It had been prophesied by  I_sildur and M_albeth the Seer that the Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying G_ondor an age before. With their aid the Corsairs of U_mbar were defeated at the Battle of P_elargir.

 A_ragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and soldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the A_nduin to M_inas T_irith. When they arrived at the Battle of the P_elennor Fields, A_ragorn unfurled a standard that A_rwen had made for him which showed both the W_hite Tree of G_ondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the House of E_lendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of G_ondor and R_ohan rallied together and defeated S_auron's army.

The Steward D_enethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant of  I_sildur (years before, he had seen "T_horongil" as a rival to his father's favor and soon discovered his true identity) and burned himself to death during the battle, despairing of final victory. A_ragorn healed F_aramir, D_enethor's last heir, É_owyn and M_erry, who together slew the W_itch-king as well as many others. This won him the immediate recognition of F_aramir as rightful heir to the throne; his humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants of G_ondor's capital city. A_ragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a sign to the people of G_ondor of the identity of their true king; as I_oreth said, "T_he hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known." The people hailed him as King that same evening.

Despite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his claim to the throne through raising the royal banner, A_ragorn decided to lay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively promoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were not out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for G_ondor at a time when the West needed to be united against S_auron. So, to avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following nights of March 15–16, he left M_inas T_irith and symbolically refused to enter it again until he was crowned King on May 1.

Captain of the West
 A_ragorn then led the Host of the West to M_ordor as per the advice of G_andalf and E_lrond, to divert S_auron's attention from F_rodo and S_am. They marched over the A_nduin river and came to M_inas M_orgul, and set fire to the fields there. Leaving a guard at the Cross-roads of the Fallen King, they began to march north along the North Road of I_thilien, and A_ragorn won a skirmish against some Orcs and E_asterlings that tried to ambush them. They then reached the desert before M_ordor, and A_ragorn allowed those who were afraid to depart to retake C_air Andros. The Army of the West then reached the B_lack Gate, and A_ragorn along with G_andalf, É_omer, I_mrahil, P_ippin, L_egolas and G_imli rode up to it and called for S_auron to come forth. He then watched as the Mouth of S_auron revealed S_auron knew about F_rodo and S_am, and saw G_andalf's rejection of S_auron's terms. The Host of the West was then encircled by S_auron's forces, a vast army of Orcs and Men. A_ragorn then arranged the Army of the West defensively on two S_lag-hills and the Battle of the M_orannon began.

After the destruction of R_ing and the defeat of S_auron, A_ragorn freed the slaves of N_úrn and gifted them the entire land in southern M_ordor.

As King of Reunited G_ondor and A_rnor
Then F_aramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice: “Men of G_ondor, hear now the Steward of this Realm! Behold! One has come to claim the kingship again at last. Here is A_ragorn, son of A_rathorn, chieftain of the D_únedain of A_rnor, Captain of the Host of the West, bearer of the Star of the North, wielder of the Sword Reforged, victorious in battle, whose hands bring healing, the E_lfstone, E_lessar of the line of V_alandil,  I_sildur's son, E_lendil's son of N_úmenor. Shall he be king and enter into the City and dwell there?" And all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice.
—F_aramir the Steward announces the coronation of King E_lessar

Upon S_auron's defeat, A_ragorn was crowned as King E_lessar, a name given to him by G_aladriel and adopted by the people of G_ondor because of the E_lfstone he wore. He became the twenty-sixth King of A_rnor, thirty-fifth King of G_ondor, and the first High King of the Reunited Kingdom, though it would be several years before his authority was firmly re-established in A_rnor. His line was referred to as the House of T_elcontar ( T_elcontar being Q_uenya for "S_trider"). A_ragorn married A_rwen shortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of G_ondor and A_rnor until 120 of the F_ourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity within G_ondor and A_rnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and communication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous rebuilding campaign following the war. A_ragorn led the forces of the Reunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some E_asterlings and H_aradrim, re-establishing rule over all the territory that G_ondor had lost in previous centuries.

End of Reign and Death
Then a great beauty was revealed in him, so that all who after came there looked on him in wonder; for they saw that the grace of his youth, and the valour of his manhood, and the wisdom and majesty of his age were blended together. And long there he lay, an image of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.
— Description of A_ragorn's death.

When in the year 120 of the F_ourth Age, King E_lessar realised his days were at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street. He said farewell to his son E_ldarion and his daughters and gave E_ldarion his crown and sceptre. A_rwen remained at A_ragorn's side until he died. A year after A_ragorn's death, A_rwen died in L_othlórien of a broken heart. E_ldarion began his reign as the second King of the Reunited Kingdom after his father's death.

Character
Was there ever anyone like him? Except G_andalf, of course. I think they must be related.
—P_eregrin T_ook on A_ragorn

's conception of A_ragorn at
Matt Stewart's conception of A_ragorn at The P_rancing Pony

T_olkien gives this description of A_ragorn in The Lord of R_ings: lean, dark, tall, with "a shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes."

In The Tale of A_ragorn and A_rwen, he was said to be often grim and sad, with unexpected moments of levity. Some time after the publications of the books, T_olkien wrote that he was six feet six inches tall.

 A_ragorn possessed Elven wisdom due to his childhood in R_ivendell with E_lrond and the foresight of the D_únedain. He was also a skilled healer, notably with the plant A_thelas (also known as Kingsfoil). He was also a mighty warrior and an unmatched commander; after the Battle of the P_elennor Fields, he, É_omer, and I_mrahil were said to be left unscathed, even though they had been in the thick of the fighting.

Though there is no indication of his ever doubting his role and destiny as the future king of the Reunited Kingdom and one of the leaders of the war against S_auron (as he did in P_eter Jackson's film), he was not immune to self-doubt, as he doubted the wisdom of his decisions while leading the_Fellowship after the loss of G_andalf in M_oria, and blamed himself for many of their subsequent misfortunes.

On one occasion his reverential pride for his heritage as caused complications as he refused to disarm and leave his sword A_ndúril at the door of E_doras as T_héoden had required. A_ragorn even vocally questioned how the authority of T_héoden could supersede his own lineage from that of E_lendil. Aragron only acquiesced after G_andalf called out his hubris as only benefiting their enemies well as highlighting that he would surrender his own sword if it meant meeting T_héoden. Even so, A_ragorn swore that death would come somehow to anyone else that touched it.

He also appeared to possess a nigh-indomitable will. At one point, he was able to psychically challenge S_auron for control of the p_alantír of O_rthanc, and proved victorious in that struggle. It should be noted that even G_andalf the White was reluctant to use the p_alantír for fear of challenging S_auron directly and revealing himself to the Dark Lord. His fortitude in the face of the Dead Men of D_unharrow was unwavering and his companions remarked that he was mighty indeed in the strength of his will. He was accounted as "the hardiest of living Men" during his lifetime.

Note on lineage
The restoration of the line of E_lendil to the throne of G_ondor is a subplot of The Lord of R_ings; A_ragorn's adventures not only aid F_rodo in his Quest, but also bring him closer to his own kingship which, though his by right and lineage, has been left open for centuries due to historical, legal, and military circumstances. The people of G_ondor have been under the rule of the Stewards of G_ondor for nearly a millennium, as it was widely doubted that any of the royal line still lived. After the Disaster of the G_ladden Fields, M_eneldil, son of A_nárion, had severed G_ondor from A_rnor politically, although the formal title of High King remained with the northern line (as I_sildur was E_lendil's eldest son). This arrangement had been reinforced by the Steward P_elendur after nearly 2,000 years when he rejected A_rvedui's claim to the throne of G_ondor during a succession crisis (E_ärnil, a member of the House of A_nárion, was eventually chosen as King instead). Notably, A_rvedui had also based his claim on the fact that he had married a descendant of A_nárion: thus, A_ragorn was technically a descendant of not only I_sildur but of A_nárion as well.

Etymology
The name A_ragorn means "revered king", from the S_indarin ara ("king") and (n)gorn ("revered"). A_ragorn was named after A_ragorn I.

Identity
The "first term" of the character that later evolved into A_ragorn or S_trider was a peculiar h_obbit met by B_ingo B_olger-B_aggins (precursor of F_rodo B_aggins) at the Inn of the P_rancing Pony. His description and behavior, however, was already quite close to the final story, with the difference that the h_obbit wore wooden shoes, and was nicknamed T_rotter for the "clitter-clap" sound that they produced. He was also accounted to be "one of the wild folk — Rangers", and he played the same role in F_rodo's journey to R_ivendell as in The Lord of R_ings.

Later T_olkien hesitated about the true identity of "T_rotter" for a long time. One of his notes suggested that the Rangers should not be h_obbits as originally planned, and that this would mean that T_rotter was either a Man or a h_obbit who associated himself with the Rangers and was "very well known" (within the story). The latter suggestion was linked to an early comment of B_ingo: "I keep on feeling that I have seen him somewhere before". T_olkien made a proposal that T_rotter might be B_ilbo B_aggins himself, but rejected that idea.

Another suggestion was that T_rotter was "F_osco T_ook (B_ilbo's first cousin), who vanished when a lad, owing to G_andalf". This story was further elaborated, making T_rotter a nephew of B_ilbo, named P_eregrin B_offin, and an elder cousin of F_rodo. He was said to have run away after he came of age, some twenty years before B_ilbo's party, and had helped G_andalf in tracking G_ollum later. A hint was also given as to why T_rotter wore wooden shoes: he had been captured by the Dark Lord in M_ordor and tortured, but saved by G_andalf; a note was added by T_olkien in the margin, saying that it would later be revealed that T_rotter had wooden feet.

The conception of T_rotter being a h_obbit was discarded with the following recommencing of writing; another short-lived idea was to make T_rotter "a disguised Elf − friend of B_ilbo's in R_ivendell", and a scout from R_ivendell who "pretends to be a Ranger".

Quite soon T_olkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of T_rotter, from the beginning introducing him as a "descendant of the ancient men of the North, and one of E_lrond's household", as well as the name A_ragorn. While the history of N_úmenor and the descendants of E_lros and E_lendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and would come to be connected with The Lord of R_ings as the character of A_ragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second and T_hird Ages was dependent on the bringing of T_rotter to association with them.

Further development
The development of A_ragorn's connection to G_ondor was long and complex, as was his association with B_oromir. Initially it is said that A_ragorn's forefathers were the exiles of N_úmenor who ruled over the people of Ond (the early name of G_ondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King "when S_auron raised a rebellion". The story of the two branches of E_lendil's descendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations only emerged gradually; at one time, T_olkien even seems to have conceived only three generations between I_sildur and A_ragorn.

One significant feature which was not established until late stages was A_ragorn's relationship with A_rwen. When T_olkien first introduced É_owyn, the interest which she showed towards A_ragorn was not one-sided, with suggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story. Another proposal was done soon, that É_owyn would die to save or avenge T_héoden, and A_ragorn would never marry after her death.

The first mention of E_lrond's daughter, named A_rwen U_ndómiel, was in reference to the banner which she made for A_ragorn, but T_olkien did not give any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references to her marriage with A_ragorn were made later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working on the appendices for The Lord of R_ings that T_olkien recorded the published version of The Tale of A_ragorn and A_rwen.

A passing idea was that G_aladriel gave her Ring to A_ragorn, and that he would accordingly be titled the "Lord of R_ing".

Rejected names
The original nickname T_rotter was retained for a long while, and T_olkien decided to change it to  S_trider only after the story was completed. There were also several experimental translations of T_rotter to S_indarin: P_adathir, Du-finnion and R_imbedir, with E_cthelion possibly being equivalent to P_eregrin (B_offin). Instead of the latter title "the D_únadan", Q_uenya T_arkil ("Noble Man") was first used, synonym with N_úmenórean.

T_olkien hesitated for some time about T_rotter's "real" name. Although A_ragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled, it was changed a number of times. At one point T_olkien decided that an Elvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from A_ragorn via E_lfstone to I_ngold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing- representing "west". Later, however, a new plot element was introduced: G_aladriel's gift of a green stone, and T_olkien reverted the usage to E_lfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained into the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a translation of E_lessar.
