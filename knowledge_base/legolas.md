L_egolas was a S_indar Elf who joined the Fellowship of the R_ing in the Third Age. Son of the Elvenking T_hranduil of M_irkwood, L_egolas was M_irkwood's prince, a messenger, and a master archer. With his keen eyesight, sensitive heaR_ing, and excellent bowmanship, L_egolas was valuable to the Fellowship in their journey across M_iddle-earth. He was well-known for becoming friends with the Dwarf G_imli, despite their long-held differences.

Early life
L_egolas was the only son of T_hranduil, King of the Elves of Northern M_irkwood. His exact date of birth and mother's name are unknown.

After the war

After the destruction of the One R_ing and of S_auron, L_egolas stayed for the coronation of A_ragorn and his marriage to A_rwen. Later, he and G_imli travelled together to H_elm's Deep, visiting the G_littering Caves, and then traveled through F_angorn Forest as the two had previously sworn to each other they would. The Caves had seemingly left such an impression upon L_egolas that he was speechless upon leaving them. Eventually, L_egolas came to I_thilien with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in M_iddle-earth helping to restore the woodlands that had been war-torn. After A_ragorn's death, L_egolas made a ship in I_thilien and left M_iddle-earth to go over the sea. His strong friendship with G_imli prompted L_egolas to invite him to accompany him to the U_ndying Lands; making G_imli the only Dwarf to do so. He was never seen again in M_iddle-earth.[15][16]

Character

Although he lived among them, L_egolas was not fully of the S_ilvan Elves. As a son of the Elven-king T_hranduil, who had originally come from D_oriath, L_egolas was at least half S_indar; his mother's identity is completely unknown. This is complicated by the fact that a small minority of S_indarin Elves ruled the predominantly S_ilvan Woodland Realm of Northern M_irkwood, a minority to which L_egolas belonged. The S_indarin minority in that realm, who should have been nobler and wiser than the S_ilvan Elves can be seen as having "gone native" at the end of the F_irst Age: after M_orgoth was defeated and all grand Elf-kingdoms of B_eleriand were destroyed, the S_indar nobles can be seen as having reverted to a simpler society.[20]

Like all Elves, L_egolas had great respect and appreciation for nature. After the Fellowship parted from F_angorn Forest, he longed to return once more to explore its wonders more thoroughly. He was kind, caring greatly for his friends, even G_imli the Dwarf, though Elves and Dwarves almost never expressed liking for one another in M_iddle-earth.[1]

Powers and abilities

As an Elf, L_egolas had the abilities typical of his race. He could walk silently on grass and snow leaving minimal footprints, allowing him to advance unhindered. His eyes were sharper than that of Men, seeing through great distances and in the dark. He could even sleep while walking, which contributed to allowing him to travel 45 leagues in less than four days with A_ragorn and G_imli. He tamed unruly horses with only a few words, without needing reins or saddles.

Weapons
L_egolas famously used an Elven bow, as well as a long, white knife. He would prefer to pierce his enemies from afar, but his dagger was sometimes used for close combat. In L_othlórien, he was given a long-bow of the G_aladhrim, which was longer and stouter than those of the fashion of M_irkwood.[21]
