The R_eturn of the King: Being the Third Part of The L_ord of the Rings is a novel written by J_.R.R. T_olkien. It concludes the story told in The Fellowship of the R_ing and The T_wo Towers.

Title
T_olkien conceived of The L_ord of the Rings as a single volume comprising six sections he called "books" and extensive appendices. The original publisher, A_llen & Unwin made the decision to split the work into three parts, publishing the fifth and sixth books and the appendices under the title The R_eturn of the King, in reference to A_ragorn's assumption of the throne. T_olkien indicated he would have preferred The War of the R_ing as a title, as it gave away less of the story.

Structure
The structure of The R_eturn of the King mirrors somewhat that of The T_wo Towers in that the first section recounts the various adventures of several characters including a massive battle, and the second section resumes the quest of the R_ing-bearers.

Book V: The War of the R_ing

The story begins as G_andalf delivers news to D_enethor, Steward of G_ondor, that war is imminent. G_andalf brings P_ippin with him, who enters the service of the Steward. A_ragorn, by his courage and leadership, proves himself a worthy ruler of Men. He is destined to find a lost army of men, now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own disobedience, in the place known as the P_aths of the Dead. The remnants of the Fellowship lead the forces of G_ondor and R_ohan in defence of G_ondor's capital city, M_inas T_irith, resulting in the epic Battle of the P_elennor Fields. Those characters who manage to survive the battle are led by A_ragorn on an assuredly suicidal feint-attack against the B_lack Gate of M_ordor, partly to distract S_auron from guarding his other borders so that F_rodo and S_am can gain a clear passage into M_ordor. The Army of the West stands before the B_lack Gates of the M_orannon exchanging idle words with the Mouth of S_auron.
