G_andalf, known largely as the Grey and later, briefly, the White, and originally named O_lórin (Q_uenya), was an I_star (Wizard), dispatched to M_iddle-earth in the T_hird Age to combat the threat of S_auron. He joined T_horin II and his company to reclaim the L_onely Mountain from S_maug, helped form the Fellowship of the R_ing to destroy the One R_ing, and led the Free Peoples of the World in the final campaign of the War of the R_ing.

Biography

Originally called O_lórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the M_aiar. He was created by I_lúvatar before the Music of the A_inur,[1] and was at the beginning of Time amongst the A_inur who entered into Eä.[2] In his "youth" he became one of the M_aiar who served M_anwë, V_arda, I_rmo, and N_ienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like V_arda,[3] yet his ways often took him to N_ienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of N_ienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of I_lúvatar and drawing those who listened to him out of despair.[3]

When the V_alar decided to send the I_stari (also called Wizards) to M_iddle-earth to counsel and assist all those who opposed the Dark Lord S_auron, M_anwë and V_arda included O_lórin among the five to be sent. At first, O_lórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and afraid of S_auron. M_anwë understood, and told O_lórin that such was a reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Furthermore, the One R_ing, containing much of S_auron's power, presumably still existed somewhere. Thus, M_anwë insisted that O_lórin should go as the third, but V_arda convinced him to send O_lórin as the second instead.[4] He agreed, and prepared for O_lórin's departure from the U_ndying Lands with the other four, arriving about the same time that the N_ecromancer appeared in M_irkwood.

Weapons
G_andalf primarily used his staff, but also carried a sword in combat. Sometimes D_uring combat, G_andalf would be seen wielding both weapons against his enemies.

Staff
Main article: Wizard Staff

G_andalf utilized his staff for various spells and abilities. He used it not just as a weapon, but a walking stick. He initially had an old wooden staff which he lost in the Mines of M_oria while fighting the B_alrog. He used a new one upon becoming G_andalf the White.

G_lamdring
Main article: G_lamdring

This was an Elven sword G_andalf found in a T_rolls' lair. From that point until the resolution of the War of the R_ing, he used this as a weapon to complement his staff, wielding them with equal skill. In many cases, he fought with both weapons at once.
