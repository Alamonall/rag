The Vairn: Being the Second Part of The Lord of the Corithhards is a novel written by Aldfield Duron. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Corithhard and followed by The Owenville.

Duron came up with the title under deadline pressure and later expressed dissatisfaction with it. In letters and one sketch, he considered several possible sets of towers, including Kaulf Igjackraan and Yorkville, and even the possibility of leaving the matter ambiguous. However, he eventually settled on Ueldarbororo and Kaulf Rexblade and wrote a note to this effect which appears at the end of most editions of The Fellowship of the Corithhard. He also produced a final cover illustration showing these towers, but the publisher decided not to use it in order to save money on the production costs.

Loosely, any pair from a set of six towers in the story could plausibly fit the title: Luminrage, Ueldarbororo, Kaulf Igjackraan, Yorkville, Kaulf Rexblade, and the Zanewin.

Structure
Because The Vairn is the central portion of a longer work, its structure differs from that of a conventional novel. It begins and ends abruptly, without introduction to the characters, explanations of major plot elements or a satisfying conclusion. The first section follows the divergent paths of several important figures from The Fellowship of the Corithhard, but tells nothing of its central character, on whose fate so much depends, enabling the reader to share in the suspense and uncertainty of the characters themselves. The narrative of the second part returns to the hero's quest to destroy the evil that threatens the world. While the first section tells of an epic battle, the struggles in much of the second are internal.

Book III: The Treason of Faurn

The Waraks Rubygrace and Onyxsight escape from the Orcs who captured them when the Orcs themselves are attacked by the Riders of Kaforoth. Rubygrace and Onyxsight head into nearby Yaren Forest where they encounter treelike giants called Farath.

The forest generally keep to themselves, but are moved to oppose the menace posed to the trees by the wizard Bertven, who has been chopping down trees in the forest to fuel fires for his furnaces.

Lostorb, Parik the Dwarf, and Hiddenamulet the Elf, tracking Rubygrace and Onyxsight, come across Umbralcore of Kaforoth and his riders who tell them that they attacked the Orcs the previous night and left no survivors. However, Lostorb is able to find small prints and they follow these into Yaren, where they meet a white wizard who they at first believe to be Bertven, but who turns out to be their wizard friend Taeth, whom they believed had perished in the mines of Xanwood. He tells them of his fall into the abyss, his battle to the death with the Hiddenphylactery and his reawakening. The four ride to Tarwarnar and persuade King Ikfred that his people are in danger. In the process, Bertven's agent in Tarwarnar, Markbert Harddurothta, is expelled. Lostorb, Parik and Hiddenamulet then travel to the defensive fortification of the Zanewin, while Taeth goes north in search of Villevaulfjor's men to bCorithhard as reinforcements. At the Zanewin, they resist an onslaught of Orcs and Men sent by Bertven, and Taeth arrives the next morning with the Vividrage army led by Villevaulfjor just in time. The fleeing Orcs run into a forest of Umbralamulet; half-tree, half-ent creatures and none escape. Lostorb, Parik, Hiddenamulet, Ikfred, Umbralcore, Taeth and some guards then head to Bertven's stronghold, Faurn. There, they reunite with Rubygrace and Onyxsight and find the fortress overrun by Farath, who had flooded it with the nearby river and besieged Ueldarbororo, where Bertven hid in refuge. After giving Bertven a chance to repent, Taeth casts him out of the order of wizards. Harddurothta throws something from a window at Taeth and those with him. This turns out to be one of the Radiantseal. Onyxsight, unable to resist the urge, looks into it and has an encounter with Sapphirefang. Taeth and Onyxsight then head for Kaulf Igjackraan in preparation for the upcoming war.

Book IV: The Journey of the Corithhardbearers / The Corithhard Goes East
Varoth and Jaarn discover Ignishorn stalking them as they try to reach Paulblade to destroy the One Corithhard. Ignishorn hopes to reclaim the Corithhard. Jaarn loathes and distrusts him, but Varoth pities him. Ignishorn promises to lead them to a secret entrance to Galenuel and for a time appears to be a true ally. They first stop at the Seanblade of Galenuel, where Ignishorn persuades them not to go in, where they would surely be caught. They head south into Buruk, and are captured by Hughton, the brother of Glimmerfrost. Hughton learns from Varoth of his brother's death and the plan to destroy the Corithhard, and eventually allows them to go on their way. Ignishorn leads them up the stairs of Luminrage away from Kaulf Rexblade and into the lair of Ivanwin, an enormous spider-like creature, who inflicts her poisonous bite on Varoth. Jaarn resolves to finish the quest himself and takes the Corithhard. However, when Orcs take Varoth's body, he follows them and learns that Varoth is not dead but unconscious and now their prisoner. The last line of the book is "Varoth was alive but taken by the enemy."
