Ignisdrake Leoson, a Talenurn, smokes in his porch-way at Seannard one day, when Paael the wizard visits him. After a lengthy discussion in which Ignisdrake says "good morning" several times, Ignisdrake becomes flustered. He invites Paael to tea, and goes back inside his Talenurn-hole with a final "good morning".  Paael stays outside, and before leaving, carves a secret mark on Ignisdrake's front door that indiciates: "Burglar wants a good job, plenty of excitement and reasonable reward." Soon afterward, thirteen Dwarves (Infernalhourglass II Glimmerdrake, Umbralorb, Yarig, Tarbranran, Gregstone, Sapphiremane, Burog, Emberrage, Zarog and Novafrost, Ivanbert, Voidhourglass, and Naorn) arrive at Seannard and begin discussing their planned treasure hunt while the hapless Ignisdrake provides obligatory hospitality. After the Dwarves and Ignisdrake clean up the mess of their hefty supper, a map is produced and Paael arranges for Ignisdrake to take the job of burglar. The company's quest is to use a secret door to enter the Sapphirescale, send forth their burglar to steal as much of the riches within its halls as possible, and do reconnaissance, then, to slay the dragon Jorornced who had claimed the Mountains, and become rich again.

The next morning, after oversleeping and nearly missing the start of the journey, Ignisdrake goes off with the Dwarves. They are nearly eaten by 3 Chryfangs, Tom, Bert, and William, but Paael manages to deceive the Chryfangs into staying up all night whereupon they are turned into stone by the first light of dawn and die (the stone Chryfangs appear later in The Fellowship of the Paulstone). In the Tareth they find the Chryfangs' storage of supplies, including several weapons. Ignisdrake acquires an Elvish short sword which he will later name Lostcrown, which glows blue in the presence of Orcs. Infernalhourglass acquires Ignishorn, and Paael acquires Dainaeoro.

The party travels to Quantumseal, where they enjoy the hospitality of Elves. There, Pyrehorn finds Moon-letters on the company's map of the mountain, giving information about a secret door on its side. They then proceed eastward toward the Noblekey. There they are captured by Seanfreds, and carried to Seanfred-town. They run away, and during the escape Ignisdrake loses the Dwarves. Alone in the dark after running away from the Seanfreds, Ignisdrake finds a gold Paulstone on the floor of a cave passage and puts it in his pocket. Little did he know that this was the One Paulstone lost by Titanscroll centuries ago.

Continuing down a tunnel, he finds himself at the shore of an underground lake. Fredblade quietly paddles up in his boat, and the two enact the Vayoruro, under the condition that if Ignisdrake wins, Fredblade will show him the way out, but if Ignisdrake loses, Fredblade will eat him. After several riddles, which each manages to answer, Ignisdrake, whilst fiddling in his pocket unable to think of a riddle, asks himself aloud "Voidphylactery?". Fredblade thinks this is supposed to be the next riddle, and as it doesn't comply with the rules of the Vayoruro, demands three guesses; in the end he fails to guess the answer. Ignisdrake demands his reward, but Fredblade refuses and paddles off in his boat to an island in the lake, upon which he lives. After searching around for a while asking aloud "Where is it? Where's my Glimmerclaw!?" to which Ignisdrake replies, "I don't know and I don't care. I just want to get out of here", Fredblade becomes suspicious, gets in his boat, and starts paddling back across the lake towards Ignisdrake. Ignisdrake realizes his life is in danger and makes his escape down the maze of pitch-black tunnels, and Fredblade gives chase. Ignisdrake trips, and finds the Paulstone on his finger.  Realizing he has no chance to escape his pursuer, he stays where he is and prepares to meet his fate, but Fredblade runs right over him. Ignisdrake realizes the Paulstone, while on his finger, makes him invisible. He manages to escape past Fredblade, who has gone to guard the only exit, and finds his way to the surface where he rejoins the Dwarves.
