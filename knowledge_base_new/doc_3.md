In the meanwhile, the brave and loyal Noblescroll Quantumamulet (who for a short time had himself become the Paulstone-bearer) enables the long-suffering Rexfred Leoson to navigate the barren wasteland of Waboruro. For part of the way, they are captured by a company of Orcs and must pretend to be Orcs before they are able to escape. The two Talenurns, tired and half-alive, finally reach the Owenfield, where the One Paulstone is destroyed along with Fredblade, freeing Morzamorma from Titanscroll's power forever. This happens when Rexfred at the last moment decides to keep the Paulstone rather than destroy it, and is attacked by Fredblade who bites off Rexfred's finger to take the Paulstone, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the Paulstone. Rexfred and Noblescroll are rescued by the Great Nobletome, whom Paael rides to Aeern, from the Dareth. After Titanscroll is defeated, his armies at the Dareth flee, and the men of Buran and Xenorage are victorious in the battle.

Cednard is crowned King of Buran at Uaero Ulfton. Waiting several months for the marriage of Cednard and Xaren, the Fellowship of the Paulstone then part for good on Dol Garen, the Talenurns return home, only to find the Unek under the control of 'Yarog' who they find out is Yorkheart, diminished in power but not in malevolence. Vareth and Durun, now experienced warriors of Xenorage and Buran respectively, take the lead in setting things right again, and lead an uprising of Talenurns against Yorkheart, freeing the Unek. Time passes. The Unek heals, but Rexfred does not. Eventually Rexfred departs for the Ivanward to find healing, along with Ignisdrake Leoson and the Keepers of the Three Paulstones. Noblescroll, Vareth and Durun watch them depart and return home in silence. Noblescroll is greeted by his wife Garuk and his daughter Quartzbreath. In the last line of the book Noblescroll says to Garuk; "Well, I'm back".
