War of the R_ing

L_egolas came to the C_ouncil of E_lrond in R_ivendell, the great meeting held by the Elf lord E_lrond, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of G_ollum. When the C_ouncil was choosing the "N_ine Walkers" to pit against the "N_ine Riders," L_egolas volunteered to represent the Elves, and to become one of the members of the Fellowship that would set out to destroy the One R_ing.[2]

During their journey, L_egolas would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On C_aradhras, L_egolas was able to run nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plough through it.[3] When G_andalf gave his counsel, L_egolas voted against passing through M_oria. In the morning, the Fellowship was waylaid by W_args and L_egolas fought in their defence. After the battle, he picked up his arrows, save one which was damaged.[4]

G_imli quarreled with him in M_oria (which was not unexpected consideR_ing the ancient quarrel between Elves and Dwarves) - L_egolas' father T_hranduil had once imprisoned G_imli's father, Glóin.[5]

He and G_imli became friends, however, when G_imli greeted the Elf, Lady G_aladriel, with gentle words. Before the Fellowship departed from L_othlórien, L_egolas was given a new G_aladhrim longbow.[6] While the Fellowship was travelling over the river A_nduin, he used his new bow to shoot an overhead N_azgûl on a fellbeast with one masterful shot in the dark.[7]

After the breaking of the Fellowship, L_egolas and A_ragorn sang a song of lament for the fall of B_oromir.[8] He then led the way as he, A_ragorn and G_imli raced through R_ohan after the U_ruk-h_ai who had taken M_erry and P_ippin. During that week, he was given a grey horse named A_rod, on which he and G_imli would often ride together, from É_omer and his é_ored.[9]

In F_angorn Forest, L_egolas, A_ragorn, and G_imli were reunited with G_andalf, now called G_andalf the White. Upon their meeting, G_andalf delivered the messages of G_aladriel to them:

L_egolas Greenleaf, long under tree, In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.
—G_aladriel's message to L_egolas[1]

In the Battle of the H_ornburg, L_egolas and G_imli engaged in an Orc-slaying contest[10] that G_imli won (the score being 42 to 43, respectively), though L_egolas was not jealous, stating, "You have passed my score by one but I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs."[11]

In R_ohan, he and G_imli followed A_ragorn, E_lladan and E_lrohir to the Paths of the Dead. His horse, A_rod, refused to enter the paths, but L_egolas calmed him. Their company rode on, with E_lladan as the last, but L_egolas looked back and saw the Dead following the Grey Company.

The Dead are following. I see shapes of Men and of horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like winter-thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.
—L_egolas in the Paths of the Dead[12]

L_egolas fought in the Battle of the P_elennor Fields with G_imli and the sons of E_lrond.[13] After the battle, he and G_imli entered M_inas T_irith; L_egolas sang an elven-song as he walked, and suggested that the city needed more gardens. They met Prince I_mrahil and went to the Houses of Healing, at which he remembered the cries of the gulls at P_elargir and sang a song about his newly kindled sea-longing.[14]
