Accompanying the _Fellowship
 A_ragorn and G_andalf had been planning their journey to M_ordor for weeks. He and G_andalf guided the Fellowship south along the line of the M_isty Mountains. When they came to Hollin, A_ragorn grew suspicious due to the lack of any sound he heard and spotted the C_rebain who were spying out the land for S_aruman. He then convinced G_andalf to try the pass over C_aradhras. However, while they were still far down the mountain, they were caught in a freak storm brought on by S_auron, and were forced to retreat. A_ragorn, together with B_oromir, made a path through the snow for the Fellowship to escape.

After it was proposed to go through M_oria, A_ragorn reluctantly agreed to go and helped fight off the W_args that attacked them during the night. Helping to rescue F_rodo from the W_atcher in the Water, once the company entered M_oria, A_ragorn remained at the back and noticed G_ollum beginning to follow them. After they were attacked in the Chamber of M_azarbul, A_ragorn fought off the attackers and killed the Orc-Chieftain, (or C_ave-troll in the movies) that had seemingly killed F_rodo. During G_andalf's battle with the B_alrog on the Bridge of K_hazad-dûm, A_ragorn ran to his side and became the Fellowship's leader after G_andalf fell, presumed dead. A_ragorn then led the company to  L_othlórien, where he visited C_erin A_mroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady G_aladriel gave him the E_lfstone.
After L_órien, A_ragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the River A_nduin to the Falls of R_auros. A_ragorn attempted to catch G_ollum several times. Though his original plan was to set out for G_ondor and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for F_rodo after the loss of G_andalf and was conflicted about what path to take.

Breaking of the _Fellowship
Fear not! he said. "Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of I_sildur and A_narion, my sires of old. Under their shadow E_lessar, the E_lfstone son of A_rathorn of the House of V_alandil  I_sildur's son heir of E_lendil, has naught to dread!
— A_ragorn proclaiming his lineage"

After passing the A_rgonath, the Fellowship camped at P_arth Galen. F_rodo saw that B_oromir had been driven mad by the influence of the One R_ing, trying to take it. F_rodo put R_ing on, rendering him invisible, and ran away from B_oromir. F_rodo climbed to the high seat on A_mon Hen; from there he could see S_auron's eye looking for him. The h_obbit felt the eye but the Dark Lord was distracted by G_andalf the White.

At this same time, the others were attacked by S_aruman's U_ruk-h_aiand a battle ensued. During the ensuing battle, B_oromir was killed defending M_erry and P_ippin, expressing his remorse privately to A_ragorn for trying to take R_ing. After discovering that F_rodo had left, A_ragorn and the others decided that they would leave F_rodo and S_am to rescue M_erry and P_ippin. L_egolas, G_imli, and A_ragorn put B_oromir's body and war gear in one of the Elven boats as a funeral boat and tribute to B_oromir for his bravery and courage. His body would be sent over the Falls of R_auros.

While F_rodo continued his quest with S_amwise G_amgee, A_ragorn, L_egolas and G_imli went to R_ohan to free M_erry and P_ippin, who had been captured by the U_ruk-h_aiin S_aruman's service.

The T_hree Hunters
 A_ragorn ran from P_arth Galen across the width of R_ohan in just four days. As they approached F_angorn Forest, the "T_hree Hunters" A_ragorn, L_egolas, and G_imli encountered É_omer, who had recently pursued and routed an Orc-band in the area. From É_omer, A_ragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped M_erry and P_ippin had been destroyed and that the h_obbits had not been found. Dejected, he led L_egolas and G_imli to the site of the battle. Clues led A_ragorn to believe that the h_obbits might still be alive, and he led the T_hree Hunters into F_angorn Forest. They did not find the h_obbits, but they did find G_andalf the White, sent back to continue his struggle against S_auron. G_andalf told the T_hree Hunters that the h_obbits were safe with the E_nts of F_angorn.

Where now are the D_unedain, E_lessar, E_lessar?
Where do thy kinsfolk wander afar?
Near is the hour when the lost should come forth,
And the G_rey Company ride from the North.
But dark is the path appointed to thee:
The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea.

- G_aladriel's message to A_ragorn
The Battle of H_ornburg
Together, G_andalf and the T_hree Hunters travelled to E_doras, where G_andalf freed T_héoden from S_aruman's enchantment and helped him organize the R_ohirrim against S_aruman. He allied with T_héoden and joined the king's É_ored, journeying to H_elm's Deep.

 A_ragorn, L_egolas and G_imli then helped the people of R_ohan in the Battle of the H_ornburg, in which they conclusively defeated S_aruman's army. Afterward A_ragorn went with G_andalf to I_sengard, only to find it in ruins by the work of the E_nts. A_ragorn, being present with G_andalf, T_héoden, É_omer, L_egolas and G_imli, negotiated in a final parley with S_aruman. S_aruman attempted to bend T_héoden to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with S_aruman. S_aruman also attempted to sway G_andalf, but failed in this also, and even so G_andalf offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness. S_aruman refused to repent out of pride and to avoid seeming a rebel to S_auron, and thus G_andalf broke S_aruman's staff and banished him from the O_rder of Wizards and the White C_ouncil. After S_aruman crawled away, G_ríma W_ormtongue threw the p_alantír of O_rthanc at G_andalf as he and the others were leaving. He missed, however, unable to decide if he hated S_aruman or G_andalf more, and thus ended the Battle of the H_ornburg and the destruction of I_sengard. After P_ippin revealed himself to S_auron in the stone, G_andalf gave the p_alantír to A_ragorn.

Not long after the G_rey Company of Rangers arrived from the north, dispatched by G_aladriel. With them rode E_lladan and H_albarad and H_albarad, bearing a standard made for him by A_rwen. When A_ragorn returned to H_elms Deep, he decided to draw S_auron out and used the p_alantír to show himself and A_ndúril to the Dark Lord, wrenching the Stone to his will after a long struggle with the Dark Lord. However, this led S_auron to swiftly send out the forces he had long prepared to attack M_inas T_irith.
